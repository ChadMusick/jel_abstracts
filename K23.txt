K23|The impact of anti-money laundering oversight on banks' suspicious transaction reporting: Evidence from Italy|We provide the first thorough investigation of the effect of anti-money laundering inspections on banks' reporting of suspicious transactions. We do so by using highly detailed data from Bank of Italy and UIF (Italian authority for anti-money laundering), which include information on i) on-site inspections by authorities and follow-up actions, and ii) quantity and quality of suspicious transactions reports being filed by banks before and after inspections. Through a difference-in-differences econometric analysis we find that inspections (notably when followed by some type of intervention by the authority) induce, ceteris paribus, an increase in suspicious transaction reports being filed by banks. Crucially, the effect is not limited to low-quality reports, as feared in the literature ('crying wolf' effect) but is spread to high-quality reports. Authorities' oversight is thus shown to increase the quantity of information shared by banks without deteriorating its quality.
K23|The Turnaround of the Swedish Economy: Lessons from Large Business Sector Reforms|How can a country improve productivity growth in its business sector and reach its growth potential? Sweden during the 1970–2010 period can serve as an example to help other countries understand how to efficiently reform a business sector. In the 1990s, Sweden implemented a reform package that ignited a successful reorganization of a business sector that had faltered for decades. To understand the economic forces behind this process, the paper first surveys the industrial restructuring literature and then examine the reform package using Swedish matched plant-firm-worker data. The removal of barriers to growth for new and productive firms, as well as increased rewards for investment in human capital, were crucial to the success of Sweden's reforms. The paper also discusses how the reform experience of a developed country such as Sweden can be useful for developing countries that are in the process of transforming their business sectors. The findings suggest that policymakers have much to learn from country case studies and that the Swedish experience can be a valuable case study for developing countries that are attempting to promote growth by developing their business sectors.
K23|Has the Swedish business sector become more entrepreneurial than the US business sector?|Recent studies document a 30-year decline in various measures of entrepreneurship in the U.S. Using detailed Swedish employer-employee data over the period from 1990 to 2013, we find young firms to be more prominent in the Swedish business sector than in the U.S. business sector. Young Swedish firms, aged five years or less, account for more than half of all firms during this period. We also observe an increase in Swedish entrepreneurial activity for start-ups. However, since the mid-2000s, job destruction rates for young firms have been increasing, which implies a declining employment share for younger firms. Moreover, most of the job creation by young firms occurs in the expanding service sector. We discuss different explanations for why Sweden appears not to have the same strong decline in entrepreneurial activity as the U.S. has had during the last two decades. We argue that one important explanation is the economic reforms that were implemented in Sweden in the 1990s that mitigated several hurdles to entrepreneurship.
K23|Macroprudential policy at the ECB: Institutional framework, strategy, analytical tools and policies|This occasional paper describes how the financial stability and macroprudential policy functions are organised at the ECB. Financial stability has been a key policy function of the ECB since its inception. Macroprudential policy tasks were later conferred on the ECB by the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) Regulation. The paper describes the ECB’s macroprudential governance framework in the new institutional set-up. After reviewing the concept and origins of systemic risk, it reflects on the emergence of macroprudential policy in the aftermath of the financial crisis, its objectives and instruments, as well as specific aspects of this policy area in a monetary union such as the euro area. The ECB’s responsibilities required new tools to be developed to measure systemic risk at financial institution, country and system-wide level. The paper discusses selected analytical tools supporting financial stability surveillance and assessment work, as well as macroprudential policy analysis at the ECB. The tools are grouped into three broad areas: (i) methods to gauge the state of financial instability or prospects of near-term systemic stress, (ii) measures to capture the build-up of systemic risk focused on country-level financial cycle measurement and early warning methods, and (iii) the ECB stress testing framework for macroprudential purposes.

K23|Bank Leverage, Welfare, and Regulation|We take issue with claims that the funding mix of banks, which makes them fragile and crisis-prone, is efficient because it reflects special liquidity benefits of bank debt. Even aside from neglecting the systemic damage to the economy that banksâ€™ distress and default cause, such claims are invalid because banks have multiple small creditors and are unable to commit effectively to their overall funding mix and investment strategy ex ante. The resulting market outcomes under laissez-faire are inefficient and involve excessive borrowing, with default risks that jeopardize the purported liquidity benefits. Contrary to claims in the literature that â€œequity is expensiveâ€ and that regulation requiring more equity in the funding mix entails costs to society, such regulation actually helps create useful commitment for banks to avoid the inefficiently high borrowing that comes under laissez-faire. Effective regulation is beneficial even without considering systemic risk; if such regulation also reduces systemic risk, the benefits are even larger.
K23|Electricity (de)regulation and innovation|In this paper we study the effect of deregulation on innovation in the electricity sector using a sample of 31 OECD countries. Exploiting sharp reductions in the level of product market regulation, explicitly linked to changes in the legal framework, we perform a difference-in-difference analysis by matching data retrieved from the OECD International Regulation, OECD Patent Grants, and UN World Development Indicators databases. Our main findings suggest that a decrease in regulation intensity, following a significant reform, has a negative impact on patents (granted by the European Patent Office). This impact appears to be mainly due to the degree of market contestability. Finally, we find evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between regulation and innovation. This may imply that the effect of deregulation on innovation depends on the strength of the deregulatory process.
K23|Decentralising the Patent System|This paper proposes a substantive re-think of the modern patent system. The patent system has come under intensive criticism in the past, and many scholars have proposed ways to improve it. Ideas for improvement include, e.g., prior-art bounties, contracting out examination and dynamic fee setting. However, many of these ideas have gone unheeded due to the cost of administering them and the rigidity of the patent system. We explore how distributed ledger technologies enable these major changes.
K23|Access to Data in Connected Cars and the Recent Reform of the Motor Vehicle Type Approval Regulation|The need for regulatory solutions for access to in-vehicle data and resources of connected cars is one of the big controversial and unsolved policy issues. Last year the EU revised the Motor Vehicle Type Approval Regulation which already entailed a FRAND-like solution for the access to repair and maintenance information (RMI) to protect competition on the automotive aftermarkets. However, the transition to connected cars changes the technological conditions for this regulatory solution significantly. This paper analyzes the reform of the type approval regulation and shows that the regulatory solutions for access to RMI are so far only very insufficiently capable of dealing with the challenges coming along with increased connectivity, e.g. with regard to the new remote diagnostic, repair and maintenance services. Therefore, an important result of the paper is that the transition to connected cars will require a further reform of the rules for the regulated access to RMI (esp. with regard to data access, interoperability, and safety/security issues). However, our analysis also suggests that the basic approach of the current regulated access regime for RMI in the type approval regulation can also be a model for developing general solutions for the currently unsolved problems of access to in-vehicle data and resources in the ecosystem of connected driving.
K23|Data-sharing in IoT Ecosystems from a Competition Law Perspective: The Example of Connected Cars|This paper analyses whether competition law can help to solve problems of access to data and interoperability in IoT ecosystems, where often one firm has exclusive control of the data produced by a smart device (and of the technical access to this device). Such a gatekeeper position can lead to the elimination of competition for after-market and other complementary services in such IoT ecosystems. This problem is analysed both from an economic and a legal perspective, and also generally for IoT ecosystems as well as for the much discussed problems of â€œaccess to in-vehicle data and resourcesâ€ in connected cars, where the â€œextended vehicleâ€ concept of the car manufacturers leads to such positions of exclusive control. The paper analyses, in particular, the competition rules about abusive behavior of dominant firms (Art. 102 TFEU) and of firms with â€œrelative market powerâ€ (Â§ 20 (1) GWB) in German competition law. These provisions might offer (if appropriately applied and amended) at least some solutions for these data access problems. Competition law, however, might not be sufficient for dealing with all or most of these problems, i.e. that also additional solutions might be needed (data portability, direct data (access) rights, or sector-specific regulation).
K23|Consumer-Lending Discrimination in the FinTech Era|Discrimination in lending can occur either in face-to-face decisions or in algorithmic scoring. We provide a workable interpretation of the courts’ legitimate-business-necessity defense of statistical discrimination. We then estimate the extent of racial/ethnic discrimination in the largest consumer-lending market using an identification afforded by the pricing of mortgage credit risk by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We find that lenders charge Latinx/African-American borrowers 7.9 and 3.6 basis points more for purchase and refinance mortgages respectively, costing them $765M in aggregate per year in extra interest. FinTech algorithms also discriminate, but 40% less than face-to-face lenders. These results are consistent with both FinTech and non-FinTech lenders extracting monopoly rents in weaker competitive environments or profiling borrowers on low-shopping behavior. Such strategic pricing is not illegal per se, but under the law, it cannot result in discrimination. The lower levels of price discrimination by algorithms suggests that removing face-to-face interactions can reduce discrimination. Further silver linings emerge in the FinTech era: (1) Discrimination is declining; algorithmic lending may have increased competition or encouraged more shopping with the ease of platform applications. (2) We find that 0.74-1.3 million minority applications were rejected between 2009 and 2015 due to discrimination; however, FinTechs do not discriminate in loan approval.
K23|New Evidence on the Effects of Mandatory Waiting Periods for Abortion|Beyond a handful of studies examining early-adopting states in the early 1990s, little is known about the causal effects of mandatory waiting periods for abortion. In this study we evaluate the effects of a Tennessee law enacted in 2015 that requires women to make an additional trip to abortion providers for state-directed counseling at least 48 hours before they can obtain an abortion. Based on our difference-in-differences approach, estimates indicate that the introduction of the mandatory waiting period caused a 62-percent increase in the share of abortions obtained during the second trimester, completely closing the pre-existing gap between Tennessee and the comparison states. Our analysis examining overall abortion rates are suggestive of reductions caused by the waiting period but these estimates are imprecise. To put these estimates into context, our back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that Tennessee's MWP increased the monetary costs of obtaining an abortion by as much as $929 for some women.
K23|The 2018 Indicators on the Governance of Sector Regulators - Part of the Product Market Regulation (PMR) Survey|Complementing the Product Market Regulation (PMR) survey, the Indicators on the Governance of Sector Regulators map the regulatory arrangements of 130 regulators across 38 countries and five network sectors: energy, e-communications, rail and air transport, and water. The indicators are structured along three components: independence, accountability and scope of action.For the 2018 update, the OECD Secretariat and delegates of the Network of Economic Regulators (NER) revised the structure and content of the survey based on new best practice principles, guidance documents and the growing body of work of the NER on the performance of regulators.The analysis shows that, while the governance arrangements of regulators vary considerably across countries and sectors, some key trends and correlations can be observed. These insights can support countries and regulators wishing to benchmark their governance practices and reform their governance arrangements.
K23|Enhancing judicial efficiency to foster economic activity in Portugal|A well-functioning justice system is indispensable to business activity and to a society as a whole. Judicial efficiency measured by trial length, one of the essential factors in the effectiveness of the justice system, ensures contract enforcement, which is the basis of market transactions. Judicial efficiency is closely associated with accessibility to judicial services and the certainty of judicial decisions, raising people’s confidence. Portugal has undertaken numerous judicial reforms in the past, to the extent that it is difficult to disentangle and evaluate fully the effects of each reform. Overall, judicial efficiency remains weak, as reflected in the average trial length and bottlenecks in a number of courts. The data collection system, significantly developed as part of the reforms, can be more fully utilised for allocating court resources. The autonomy of the judicial council and court presidents can also be strengthened so that they can effectively manage resources. Individual judges can be better incentivised through performance-oriented evaluation. Competition in the legal profession sector can be enhanced while increasing the transparency of legal services. Also, alternative dispute resolution mechanisms can be developed further, meeting different needs for judicial services, in particular those on insolvency, while alleviating court congestion. Finally, building on past and ongoing reform efforts, the judicial system should continue to improve the capacity to undertake forensic investigations of economic and financial crimes.This Working Paper relates to the 2018 OECD Economic Survey of Portugal(http://www.oecd.org/economy/portugal-economic-snapshot/)
K23|One-In, X-Out: Regulatory offsetting in selected OECD countries|Governments are increasingly trying to limit the costs of regulatory compliance. One of the approaches that has been gaining ground in the last five years is the “one-in, x-out rule”, or the offsetting of regulatory costs stemming from new regulations by reducing the existing regulatory stock. This paper presents examples of regulatory offsetting approaches in selected OECD countries. By comparing the different approaches and discussing their key features, the paper provides guidance to countries considering introducing regulatory offsetting. This paper finds that there are many methodological and implementation issues that need to be resolved before a government decides to use a one-in, x-out approach as part of its regulatory policy. Key suggestions for countries introducing regulatory offsetting include i) ensuring a solid methodology for calculating regulatory costs; ii) linking the responsibility for finding offsets to the “owners” of regulation; iii) setting up quality oversight mechanisms; iv) securing strong political commitment and support and v) implementing regulatory offsetting as a complement to other regulatory management tools.

K23|Ownership and control policy of broadcasting services in Ireland: reflections on recent proposals|The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is proposing: in assessing changes in the ownership and control of broadcasting licenses that the viability/sustainability of broadcasting services should be ranked second out of eight policy objectives; and, facilitating greater concentration of ownership of commercial radio stations through limited relaxation of the current ownership thresholds. There is insufficient justification for either proposal. The viability/sustainability objective is already addressed on an ex ante basis when a broadcaster is licensed. The ex ante evaluation should be strengthened by retaining (rather than abolishing) the existing BAI two-year time limit on a licensee being able to transfer ownership. If the viability/sustainability objective is, however, to be retained then it should be ranked much lower than second out of eight objectives. In terms of the BAI’s proposals for facilitating greater concentration of ownership of commercial radio stations, serious consideration should be given to retaining (not abolishing) the Five Additional Factors that go to the heart of plurality and diversity which are core, not peripheral, to the aims and objectives of the BAI. Furthermore the BAI should provide greater clarity how the tests to approve the transfer of a radio license are applied, through guidance and the publication of reasoned decisions.

K23|The impact of Foreign Direct Investment and the institutional quality on Welfare in Latin America and Sub-saharan Africa|This article examines the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) and institutional quality on well-being in Latin American and sub-Saharan African countries between 1996-2014. We use as key variables FDI, indicators of institutional quality (control of corruption and the rule of law) and the Human Development Index (HDI) as the main variables. Our analyzes confirm the positive and significant relationship between FDI and well-being in Latin America. Although the rule of law has been established to improve well-being. This result shows that legal variables of institutional quality play an important role in improving well-being. Nevertheless, this relationship between FDI, institutional quality and well-being is significantly different between Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. So legal indicators create a positive effect on well-being. This study shows that institutional quality indicators attack well-being in the Latin American region. In addition, the quality of institutions and the strengthening of governance tend to amplify the positive effects on well-being in the region. The result of the regression confirms the positive links between FDI, institutional quality and improved well-being. Regarding the impact of FDI and institutional quality on well-being, FDI and the rule of law have more impact on improving well-being in Latin American countries than in sub-Saharan African countries.
K23|The role of political instability and corruption on foreign direct investment in the MENA region|The interest of this paper is to show the influence of political instability and corruption on foreign direct investment and its different effects among MENA countries. Political instability and corruption are highlighted as a risk factor for the foreign investor who generates several costs for economic activity and remains a major determinant of FDI. The combination of political instability and corruption contributes to the revolution in these countries such as Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and weak economic integrations in general explain the low attractiveness of MENA countries for foreign investors. It is widely argued that good governance is an important factor of FDI. With the exception of studies of corruption, however, empirical research on the link between governance and FDI is limited, particularly in the context of MENA countries. Corruption and political instability are the governance indicators that seem to have the greatest impact on foreign direct investment (FDI). An increase in FDI has the greatest effect on development in politically stable regimes. Studies of corruption and its relation to foreign direct investment (FDI) have yielded mixed results; some have found that corruption discourages FDI, but others have found the opposite. The study covers the MENA region for the period 1996-2016. Using the panel data technique and the results obtained indicate a negative relationship between political instability and foreign direct investment and between corruption and FDI.
K23|ASEAN Economic Development: Impacts and Adaptation for Thai Local Administrative Organizations|Economic development is influenced by domestic development and international obligations. Local administrative organizations may have to bear the effects of various aspects of economic development. Current fundamental problems concerning the role, power and duties of the Local administrative organizations result from the separation of governance to the central, the regional, and the local administrative organizations. Local administrative organizations are again divided into provincial administrative organizations, municipalities, and sub-district administrative organizations. The fundamental issues concerning Thai governance, especially in any specific province, is the separation of roles, powers, duties, budget, and personnel of organizations in a manner in which they are dispersed through the various governmental offices at the department level based on their missions and duties. Concurrently, the administration at local levels has overlapping jurisdiction between provincial administrative organizations and the municipality, and sub-district administrative organizations. The nature of these problematic issues is one that currently exists; however, another dimension is the state of global transformation which poses an additional challenge for the role, power, and duties of Local administrative organizations. This study aims at examining the impacts and adaptation for Thai local administrative organizations resulting from the economic development of ASEAN. The study is separated into three parts: 1) Thailand and economic development in ASEAN; 2) the impact of the local administrative organization toward economic development and 3) analysis and recommendations for Thai local administrative organizations.
K23|Screening instruments for monitoring market power: The return on withholding capacity index (RWC)|While markets have been liberalized all over the world, incumbents often still hold a dominant position, e.g. on energy markets. Thus, wholesale electricity markets are subject to market surveillance. Nevertheless, consolidated findings on abusive practices of market power and their cause and effect in these markets are scarce and non-controversial market monitoring practices fail to exist. Right now, the Residual Supply Index (RSI) is the most important instrument for market monitoring. However, a major drawback of this index is its focus on just one specific aspect of market power in wholesale electricity markets whereas different consequences of market power are possible. Hence, markets could be distorted in several ways and we propose the 'Return on Withholding Capacity Index' (RWC) as a complementary index to the RSI. The index is a measure of the firms' incentive to withhold capacity. The benefits and practicability of the RWC is shown by an application on data for the German-Austrian electricity wholesale market in 2016.
K23|"Digitization and knowledge spillover effectiveness: Evidence from the ""German Mittelstand"""|The Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship (KSTE) considers determinants of knowledge diffusion as well as their impact on entrepreneurial activities and growth. Extending the KSTE, the role of incumbent firms for the broad diffusion of new knowledge has been emphasized. For those firms, the barriers to an effective flow of information are considered using the concepts of knowledge filters and absorptive capacities. Both concepts enable the derivation of institutional measures to penetrate knowledge filters and systematically increase absorptive capacities. We interpret the process of digitization as a central process of knowledge spillover in recent years and determine digitization-related knowledge filters for particular domains of firm decision-making. Using a consultant-based in-depth evaluation of 200 SMEs conducted in the context of a federal innovation program, structural drivers, firm clusters and domain-specific knowledge filters for digitization are determined. We find little evidence for structural drivers of knowledge spillover effectiveness. However, as firms are clustered according to their digitization pattern, we show that firms realize high degrees of digitization in most domains or in none, leading us to argue that domain-specific knowledge filters are weak. Rather, knowledge spillover in digitization can be considered a process with initially strong general knowledge filter and - once this filter has been penetrated - weaker subsequent domain-specific knowledge filters. Policy and managerial implications for increasing digitization-related knowledge spillovers in SMEs are discussed.
K23|Happily ever after? Vertical and horizontal mergers in the U.S. media industry|This paper provides an economic analysis of recent vertical and horizontal mergers in the U.S. industry for audiovisual media content, including the AT&T-Time Warner and the Disney-Fox mergers. Using a theory-driven approach, we examine economic effects of these types of mergers on market competition, focusing on digital media content distribution. In doing so, we address three research questions: (i) Is the current development of analyzing industry with its recent merger activity concerning? (ii) Would vertical or horizontal integration be more preferable for overall welfare and competition in this industry? (iii) What are implications for antitrust policy? We conclude from our analysis that in the already highly horizontally concentrated U.S. market for audiovisual content the process of further vertical integration creates concerns from a competition policy perspective. Moreover, even though horizontal concentration on some of the market stages may be anticompetitive as well, vertical integration is likely to be more harmful. As a consequence, we recommend a stricter approach to vertical merger control in this industry, as well as a more active abuse control against already vertically-integrated media companies.
K23|Public interest considerations in European merger control regimes|Nowadays, merger control predominantly relies upon a strict analysis of the effects from merger and acquisitions on effective competition. However, there is scope for so-called public interest considerations in several European merger control regimes and recently a number of European politicians have called for more elbowroom for non-competition-oriented interventions into merger control. For instance, they did so in the context of the prohibition of the Siemens-Alstommerger and the upcoming industrial policy discussion about European Champions. Since the social welfare effects of competitive markets present an important public interest in itself, additional public interest considerations justifying an intervention need to be non-market in the sense that these goals stand in conflict with competition. However, a trade-off between effective competition and public interest, i.e. public interests that are better served through market power then through effective competition, is a rare phenomenon. This paper gives an overview of public interest considerations in the merger policy of European Union member states and analyzes four jurisdictions in more detail. We find that the institutional designs how public interests considerations are included in the merger control regimes lack focus on non-market public interest considerations across the analyzed jurisdictions. Furthermore, there are relevant shortcomings regarding transparency and legal certainty. Moreover, our ex-pots analysis shows that the empirical record of past public interest-motivated interventions is questionable with only few interventions yielding the desired effects. Therefore, we suggest revising the public interest regulations in the respective merger control regulations by narrowing their focus to real non-market public interests and by levying decision power on less politically-influenced bodies.
K23|Evidence and Actions on Mortgage Market Disparities: Research, Fair Lending Enforcement and Consumer Protection|In this article, we present overviews of the research on discrimination in mortgage underwriting and pricing, the experiences of minority borrowers prior to and during the financial crisis and federal efforts to mitigate foreclosures during the crisis. We next discuss the history of legal cases alleging disparate treatment of minority borrowers, and recent cases alleging disparate impact in the wake of the Supreme Court’s “Inclusive Communities” decision. Using these discussions as a background, we discuss and examine mortgage regulations issued by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau following the financial crisis, describe recent developments in the FinTech industry discussing their implications for fair lending policy and minority borrowers more generally, and finally draw conclusions and make recommendations for improving the mortgage market outcomes of minority borrowers and increasing minority borrowers’ access to credit.
K23|Light cannabis and organized crime: Evidence from (unintended) liberalization in Italy|This paper explores the unintended liberalization of light cannabis that occurred in Italy in December 2016 by means of a legislative gap in order to assess its effect on the illegal supply of marijuana. Although liberalization interested the entire Italian territory, in the short run, the level of intensity varied according to the pre-liberalization market configuration of grow shops, i.e., retailers that sold industrial cannabis-related products. We exploit this variation using a differences-in-differences (DID) design with a unique dataset on monthly confiscations of drugs at the province level during 2016–2018, which is matched with data on the geographical location of shops and socio-demographic variables. We find that the liberalization of light cannabis led to a reduction of up to 14% in marijuana confiscations per each pre-existing grow shop and a significant decrease in both other cannabis-derived drugs and in the number of people arrested for drug-related offences. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that forgone revenue for criminal organizations amount to at least 90–170 million euros per year. These results support the argument that the supply of illegal drugs is displaced by the entry of official and legal retailers.
K23|The Death of a Regulator: Strict Supervision, Bank Lending and Business Activity|An important question in banking is how strict supervision affects bank lending and in turn local business activity. Forcing banks to recognize losses could choke off lending and amplify local economic woes. But stricter supervision could also change how banks assess and manage loans. Estimating such effects is challenging. We exploit the extinction of the thrift regulator (OTS) — a large change in prudential supervision — to analyze economic links between strict supervision, bank lending and business activity. We first show that the OTS replacement indeed resulted in stricter supervision of former OTS banks. Next, we analyze the ensuing lending effects. We show that former OTS banks increase small business lending by roughly 10 percent. This increase is not entirely accounted by a reallocation of mortgage lending and stems primarily from well-capitalized banks and those more affected by the new regime. These findings suggest that stricter supervision operates not only through capital but can also overcome frictions in bank management, leading to more lending and a reallocation of loans. Consistent with the latter, we find increases in business entry and exit in counties with greater expose to OTS banks.
K23|Die EU-Insolvenzrichtlinie zu vorinsolvenzlichen Verfahren aus ordnungspolitischer Perspektive<BR>[The EU directive on preventive restructuring frameworks from a ordoliberal perspective]|Das Papier analysiert die EU-Richtlinie zum vorinsolvenzlichen Verfahren (2016/0359 (COD)) vor dem Hintergrund der anhaltend lockeren Geldpolitik aus ordnungspolitischer Perspektive. Es wird gezeigt, dass die Voraussetzungen geschaffen werden, durch strategische Kreditvergabe an Unternehmen im vorinsolvenzlichen Verfahren auf Kosten anderer Gläubiger auf Bewertungsgewinne durch Insolvenz zu spekulieren. Zudem kann in einem Umfeld zunehmender Zombifizierung die Haftung von wirtschaftlich schwachen Unternehmen auf Kosten von leistungsfähigen Unternehmen und Banken aufgeweicht werden. Aus ordnungspolitischer Sicht ist die Richtlinie deshalb kritisch zu betrachten.
K23|Incentive Regulation: Evidence From German Electricity Networks|We propose a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach to estimate the impact of incentives on cost reduction. We show theoretically, and estimate empirically, that German electricity distribution system operators (DSOs) pile up more costs in the year used to determine future prices when subject to a lower-powered regulation mechanism. The difference is particularly significant (about 10% of total cost) for firms in the upper quartile of the efficiency distribution, a pattern which is consistent with the pooling of types under the threat of ratcheting. In light of heterogeneous network reinforcement across DSOs due to local wind and solar power expansion, cost inflation will particularly hit already hard-struck DSOs’ customers.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

K23|Power Sector Reform and Corruption: Evidence from Electricity Industry in Sub-Saharan Africa|We analyse the impact of corruption and two key aspects of electricity sector reforms, such as the creation of independent regulatory agencies and private sector participation, on several performance indicators in Sub-Saharan Africa. We find that corruption reduces technical efficiency of the sector and constrains the efforts to increase access to electricity and national income. However, some negative effects are offset where independent regulators are established and privatisation is implemented. Our findings suggest that well-designed reforms not only boost economic performance of the sector, but also reduce the negative effects of macro-level institutional deficiencies, such as corruption, on performance indicators.
K23|Does state aid for broadband deployment in rural areas close the digital and economic divide?|We evaluate the impact of a major European state aid programme for speed upgrades in broadband internet availability applied to rural areas in the German state of Bavaria throughout 2010 and 2011. We use a matched difference-in-differences estimation strategy that compares treated and untreated municipalities that are balanced with respect to funding criteria. We find that aided municipalities have a significantly higher broadband coverage at higher speed than non-aided municipalities. This increase in broadband coverage does not, on average, benefit the local population in terms of increase in local jobs per resident or wages. However, these effects are heterogeneous across skill groups. Furthermore, we find positive effects on the employment rate among residents. Taking these results together suggests that an increase in broadband coverage through state aid protects rural areas from depopulation (while residents work at other locations), but does not contribute to a further closing of the economic divide in the form of creating new jobs.

We first develop a theoretical model, which shows that the relation between the number of competitors and investment in a quality-improving technology can be positive if the quality of the new technology is high enough, and is negative otherwise. We test these theoretical predictions using data on broadband deployments in France in more than 36,000 local municipalities. First, using panel data over the period 2011-2014, we estimate a model of entry into local markets by alternative operators using local loop unbundling (LLU). Second, using cross-sectional data for the year 2015, we estimate how the number of LLU entrants impacts the deployment of high-speed broadband, controlling for the endogeneity of LLU entry. We find that a higher number of LLU competitors implies lower incentives to deploy and expand coverage of fast broadband, with speed of 30Mbps or more. By contrast, a higher number of local competitors has a positive effect on the incentive to deploy super-fast broadband, with speed of 100Mbps or more, but has no significant effect on the incentive to expand coverage of this technology.
K23|Procurement Centralization in the EU: the Case of Italy|This paper analyzes the process of centralization of public procurement in Europe, with an emphasis on the Italian case. It illustrates the main normative and regulatory reforms that took place between 2000 and 2016 at both EU and Italian levels. It then empirically evaluates the potential distortions induced by the most recent wave of centralization reforms. Using procurement data on all Italian public contracts awarded between 2015 and 2017, it finds that administrations expecting to lose their ability to contract independently game the centralization requirements in three ways. In the short run, they anticipate their purchases to avoid delegating to a central body. In the longer run, they both manipulate contract values, breaking down purchases into smaller lots of amounts below the thresholds driving centralization requirements, and, when given the option, aggregate into the smallest types of centralized purchasing bodies. These three distortions partially offset the potential benefits of the centralization reforms.
K23|International Migration Intentions and Illegal Costs: Evidence Using Africa-to-Europe Smuggling Routes|Irregular migrants from Africa and the Middle East flow into Europe along land and sea routes under the control of human smugglers. The demise of the Gaddafi regime in 2011 marked the opening of the Central Mediterranean Route for irregular border crossing between Libya and Italy. This resulted in the immediate expansion of the global smuggling network, which produced an asymmetric reduction in bilateral distance between country pairs across the Mediterranean sea. We exploit this source of spatial and time variation in irregular migration routes to estimate the elasticity of migration intentions to illegal moving costs proxied by distance. We build a novel dataset of geolocalized time-varying migration routes, combined with cross-country survey data on individual intentions to move from Africa (and the Middle East) into Europe. Netting out any country-by-time and pair-level confounders we find a large negative effect of distance along smuggling routes on individual migration intentions. Shorter distances increase the willingness to migrate especially for youth, (medium) skilled individuals and those with a network abroad. The effect is stronger in countries closer to Libya and with weak rule of law.
K23|Human Smuggling and Intentions to Migrate: Global Evidence from a Supply Shock along Africa-to-Europe Migration Routes|Africa-to-Europe irregular migration depends heavily on human smuggling services. The demise of the Gaddafi regime in 2011 marked the end of a bilateral agreement between Italy and Libya and opened the Central Mediterranean Route for irregular border crossing. How did this remarkable increase in human smuggling services affect migration intentions in the rest of the region? This paper isolates a causal impact by exploiting the spatial dimension of the smuggling network and its change over time, which produced a heterogeneous decrease in bilateral migration distances between countries in Africa and Europe. We use this source of variation and a novel dataset of bilateral distances along irregular land and sea routes, combined with cross-country survey data on individual intentions to move from Africa to Europe between 2010 and 2012. Netting out pair- and country-by-time-specific fixed effects, we find a large negative effect of distance along smuggling routes on individual migration intentions. Shorter distances increase the willingness to migrate especially for youth, (medium) skilled individuals and those with a network abroad. The effect is stronger in origin countries not too far from Libya and with weak rule of law.
K23|Data for Good: Unlocking Privately-Held Data to the Benefit of the Many|It is almost a truism to argue that data holds a great promise of transformative resources for social good, by helping to address a complex range of societal issues, ranging from saving lives in the aftermath of a natural disaster to predicting teen suicides. Yet it is not public authorities who hold this real-time data, but private entities, such as mobile network operators and business card companies, and - with even greater detail - tech firms such as Google through its globally-dominant search engine, and, in particular, social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. Besides a few isolated and self-proclaimed ‘data philanthropy’ initiatives and other corporate data-sharing collaborations, data-rich companies have historically shown resistance to not only share this data for the public good, but also to identify its inherent social, non-commercial benefit. How to explain to citizens across the world that their own data - which has been aggressively harvested over time - can’t be used, and not even in emergency situations? Responding to this unsettling question entails a fascinating research journey for anyone interested in how the promises of big data could deliver for society as a whole. In the absence of a plausible solution, the number of societal problems that won’t be solved unless firms like Facebook, Google and Apple start coughing up more data-based evidence will increase exponentially, as well as societal rejection of their underlying business models. This article identifies the major challenges of unlocking private-held data to the benefit of society and sketches a research agenda for scholars interested in collaborative and regulatory solutions aimed at unlocking privately-held data for good.
K23|Sector reforms and institutional corruption: Evidence from electricity industry in Sub-Saharan Africa|In order to reduce the influence of corruption on electricity sector performance, most Sub-Saharan African countries have implemented electricity sector reforms. However, after nearly two and half decades of reforms, there is no evidence whether the reforms have mitigated corruption. Neither is there evidence of performance improvement of the reforms in terms of technical, economic or welfare impact. This paper aims to fill this gap. We use a dynamic panel estimator with a novel panel data of 47 Sub-Saharan African countries from 2002 to 2013. We analyse the impact of corruption and two key aspects of electricity reforms – creations of independent regulatory agencies and private sector participation – on three key performance indicators: technical efficiency, access to electricity and income. We find that corruption can significantly reduce technical efficiency of the sector and constrain the efforts to increase access to electricity and national income. The adverse effects are reduced where independent regulatory agencies are established and privatisation is implemented. These findings suggest that well-designed reforms not only boost the performance of the sector directly, but also indirectly reduce the negative effects of macro level institutional deficiencies such as corruption on micro and macro performance indicators.
K23|Measuring the Implementation of the FSB Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions in the European Union|"There are lingering concerns about the health of European banks and extensive market commentary about whether post-crisis regulatory reforms in Europe have adequately addressed these concerns. In June 2012, European policymakers released the broad outlines of a proposal for a ""European banking union"" to strengthen the banking sector and help assuage concerns of investors and depositors, however, uncertainty remains regarding how the new EU bank resolution regime, the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), will work in practice. This paper addresses whether the BRRD has fulfilled the requirements of the FSB Key Attributes for Resolution Regimes, which many take to be the gold standard bank resolution framework. We find that the BRRD diverges from the FSB Key Attributes or allows variation at the Member State level in multiple areas. The majority of these variations point to slight inconsistencies with the FSB recommendations. That said, some variations may have a larger impact than others."

K23|A game theory approach to optimizing the banking and financial resolution framework|Before the 2007-2008 financial crisis, creditinstitutions were assured (though not officially or formally) that if they were large enough they would be rescued with tax-payers’ money, an action also known as bail-out, denoting what became known as the “too big to fail” paradigm. The introduction of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (2014/59/EU) proposes a legal framework that aims at eliminating the possibility of bailing-out institutions. This paper has the objective of assessing througha game theory approachto what extent the BRRDirectivehas the potential to achieve its purpose and if there are identifiable possible improvements to this framework that could be considered for practical purposes or for a possible future review of the legal framework.The term institution, for the purpose of this paper, refers to credit institutions but can also be read as referring to other types of financial institutions such as investment firms or insurance companies
K23|Sanzioni antitrust e vaglio giurisdizionale: uno sguardo alla tecnica di quantificazione|Da una disamina ad ampio spettro della casistica antitrust italiana in tema di intese e abuso di posizione dominante Ã¨ emersa unâ€™elevata propensione del giudice amministrativo nazionale a rideterminare (nel 52% dei casi) lâ€™importo delle sanzioni pecuniarie comminate dallâ€™AutoritÃ Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM). Tale considerazione sembra confermata, in ottica comparativa, dal basso tasso di ricorsi accolti (10%) presso la Corte di Giustizia dellâ€™Unione Europea in tema di contenzioso antitrust. Da tale evidenza emergono alcuni quesiti. Il Giudice, quando esercita il suo sindacato di merito, si attiene alla stessa metodologia su cui si basa lâ€™AutoritÃ ? Modificando la sanzione, incide sulla funzione deterrente della stessa. Quindi: emerge un rischio di inficiare la capacitÃ deterrente della sanzione? Su tale sfondo, il presente lavoro indaga le modalitÃ con cui il giudice amministrativo italiano motiva e lega, nel dispositivo, lâ€™accolto con lâ€™effettiva rideterminazione eseguita. Lâ€™analisi sui casi parte da un dataset composto da n. 524 sanzioni AGCM comminate per abuso di posizione dominante e intese nel periodo 2000-2015. Per analizzare lâ€™approccio implementato dal giudice amministrativo si sono vagliati tutti i casi (n. 119) di procedimenti con sanzioni rideterminate a seguito di ricorso giurisdizionale. Le risultanze dellâ€™analisi condotta portano a ritenere fondato il timore che lâ€™opera del Giudice possa occasionalmente, tramite lâ€™attivitÃ di ridetermina, incidere sullâ€™efficienza ed efficacia complessiva dellâ€™apparato sanzionatorio antitrust. Tale rischio, andatosi attenuando nel tempo, puÃ² derivare da una incertezza metodologica alla base del calcolo della sanzione. Incertezza che si ritiene tanto piÃ¹ ampia quanto maggiore Ã¨ il distacco logico dalla tecnica tracciata nelle guidelines.

K23|Evidence and Actions on Mortgage Market Disparities: Research, Fair lending Enforcement and Consumer Protection|In this article, we present overviews of the research on discrimination in mortgage underwriting and pricing, the experiences of minority borrowers prior to and during the financial crisis and federal efforts to mitigate foreclosures during the crisis. We next discuss the history of legal cases alleging disparate treatment of minority borrowers, and recent cases alleging disparate impact in the wake of the Supreme Court’s “Inclusive Communities” decision. Using these discussions as a background, we discuss and examine mortgage regulations issued by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau following the financial crisis, describe recent developments in the FinTech industry discussing their implications for fair lending policy and minority borrowers more generally, and finally draw conclusions and make recommendations for improving the mortgage market outcomes of minority borrowers and increasing minority borrowers’ access to credit.
K23|How Much of Barrier to Entry is Occupational Licensing?|We exploit state variation in licensing laws to study the effect of licensing on occupational choice using a boundary discontinuity design. We find that licensing reduces equilibrium labor supply by an average of 17%-27%. The negative labor supply effects of licensing appear to be strongest for white workers and comparatively weaker for black workers.

K23|Data Governance in Connected Cars: The Problem of Access to In-vehicle Data|Through the application of the technological solution of the “extended vehicle” concept the car manufacturers can capture exclusive control of the data of connected cars leading to serious concerns about negative effects on competition, innovation and consumer choice on the markets for aftermarket and other complementary services in the ecosystem of connected and automated driving. Therefore a controversial policy discussion has emerged in the EU about access to in-vehicle data and the connected car for independent service providers in the automotive industry. This paper claims that this problem should be seen as part of the general question of the optimal governance of data in the ecosystem of connected and automated mobility. The paper offers an overview about this policy discussion and analyzes this problem from an economic perspective by using a market failure analysis. Besides competition problems (esp. on markets for aftermarket and other services in the connected car) also market failures in regard to technological choice (extended vehicle vs. interoperable on-board application platform) and information and privacy problems (“notice and consent” solutions) can emerge, leading to the question of appropriate regulatory solutions. The paper discusses solutions through data portability, data rights, competition law, and recommends a sector-specific regulatory approach.

K23|Competition Policy and Sector-Specific Regulation in the Financial Sector|Reforms of financial regulation after the crisis of 2007-2009 raise the question of what is the relation between financial regulators and competition authorities. Should competition authorities play a role in financial regulation? Should they co-operate with financial regulators? Or should they keep at a distance? The paper gives an overview over some of the issues that are involved in the discussion. Drawing on the experience of the network industries, the first part of the paper discusses the relation between competition authorities and sector-specific regulators more generally. Whereas competition policy involves the application of legal norms involving prohibitions that are formulated in abstract terms, sector-specific regulation involves authorities actually prescribing desired modes of behavior. The ongoing nature of relations makes regulators more prone to capture than competition authorities. In the financial sector, the potential for capture is particularly great because everyone is tempted by the idea that banks should fund their pet projects. Following an overview over the evolution of regulation and competition in the financial industry, the paper discusses various issues that are relevant for competition policy: Technological and regulatory barriers to entry, distortions of competition by explicit or implicit government guarantees, distortions of competition by bailouts making for artificial barriers to exit. Guarantees and bailouts in particular pose special challenges for merger control and for state aid control.
K23|Bank Leverage, Welfare, and Regulation|We take issue with claims that the funding mix of banks, which makes them fragile and crisis-prone, is efficient because it reflects special liquidity benefits of bank debt. Even aside from neglecting the systemic damage to the economy that banks’ distress and default cause, such claims are invalid because banks have multiple small creditors and are unable to commit effectively to their overall funding mix and investment strategy ex ante. The resulting market outcomes under laissez-faire are inefficient and involve excessive borrowing, with default risks that jeopardize the purported liquidity benefits. Contrary to claims in the literature that “equity is expensive” and that regulation requiring more equity in the funding mix entails costs to society, such regulation actually helps create useful commitment for banks to avoid the inefficiently high borrowing that comes under laissez-faire. Effective regulation is beneficial even without considering systemic risk; if such regulation also reduces systemic risk, the benefits are even larger.
K23|A Probative Value for Authentication Use Case Blockchain|The Fintech industry has facilitated the development of companies using blockchain technology. The use of this technology inside banking system and industry opens the route to several questions regarding the business activity, legal environment and insurance devices. In this paper, considering the creation of small companies interested to develop their business with a public blockchain, we analyse from different aspects why a company (in banking or insurance system, and industry) decides that a blockchain protocal is more legitimate than another one for the business it wants to develop looking at the legal (in case of dispute) points of view. We associate to each blockchain a probative value which permits to assure in case of dispute that a transaction has been really done. We illustrate our proposal using thirteen blockchains providing in that case a ranking between these blockchains for their use in business environment. We associate to this probative value some main characteristics of any blockchain as market capitalization and log returns volatilities that the investors need to take also into account with the new probative value for their managerial strategy
K23|The New Prescription Drug Paradox: Pipeline Pressure and Rising Prices|Economic literature has extensively studied how prices for incumbent pharmaceutical drugs respond to generic competition after entry. However, less attention has been paid to pricing behavior in anticipation of brand-to-brand competition. We contribute to this gap in the literature by both developing a model of pricing strategies for incumbent drug manufacturers under tiered-insurance anticipating branded competition. Our model predicts rising prices for incumbent drugs for a range of elasticities as the likelihood of entry increases from competitors with horizontally-differentiated products. Using the insulin market as a natural experiment, we exploit exogenous variation in a potential entrant's completion of clinical trials to identify the effect of drug pipeline pressure on the prices of incumbent drugs. Results suggest that pipeline pressure significantly increases the prices of incumbent drugs. We expect that similar pricing effects will be prevalent with potential biosimilar entry.
K23|From Revolving Doors to Regulatory Capture? Evidence from Patent Examiners|Many regulatory agency employees are hired by the firms they regulate, creating a “revolving door” between government and the private sector. We study these transitions using detailed data from the US Patent and Trademark Office. We find that patent examiners grant significantly more patents to the firms that later hire them and that much of this leniency extends to prospective employers. These effects are strongest in years when firms are actively hiring, and these relationships hold for the intensive margin of intellectual property protection. Ultimately, this leads the agency to issue lower quality patents, which we measure in citations. Together with other supporting evidence, we argue these results are suggestive of regulatory capture.
K23|Job Market Signaling through Occupational Licensing|A large literature demonstrates that occupational licensing is a labor market friction that distorts labor supply allocation and prices. We show that an occupational license serves as a job market signal, similar to education. In the presence of occupational licensing, we find evidence that firms rely less on observable characteristics such as race and gender in determining employee wages. As a result, licensed minorities and women experience smaller wage gaps than their unlicensed peers.
K23|How Much of Barrier to Entry is Occupational Licensing?|We exploit state variation in licensing laws to study the effect of licensing on occupational choice using a boundary discontinuity design.

K23|Greater certainty in trade relations?: understated strategic alliances, vital legislation, trade and regional agreements|It appears the United States Senate may have been trying to make the points that renegotiating or enacting new legislations require more energy, efforts and time than many would appreciate – particularly in the processes and attempts involved in dismantling the Affordable Care Act – an attempt which ultimately proved unsuccessful – even though certain key elements were eventually replaced through the Tax Reform Bill which was approved in December 2017 – the first major legislative success of the Trump Administration. However the Affordable Care Act remains a testimony of efforts which had been invested in designing a legislation – which although not the ultimate legislation for some, still partially addresses certain concerns of the medical system. Certain other agreements have not had it so easy during the first twelve months of the new administration. Notably, the Trans Pacific Partnership, the Paris Global Climate Agreement – and even the North American Free Trade Area (still being re negotiated) – which have either been withdrawn from, or face the threat of being withdrawn from. So which alliances appear to have been understated, dismantled or being re considered, during and following the first year marking the inauguration of the 45th President of the United States?
K23|Modification of the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) on Indonesia's trade, investment, and industrial incentive policies|This paper modifies the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) method and applies it on Indonesia's trade, investment, and industrial incentive policies. First, it analyses the Indonesian Bilateral Trade Agreements (BTAs) utilizing trade and investment agreement. Indonesia currently has two BTAs in force. One, Indonesia – Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (IJEPA) and two, Indonesia – Pakistan Preferential Trade Agreement (IP-PTA). This paper found that the outcome expectation for trading partner depends on its GNI per capita. If the trading partner has GNI per capita higher than Indonesia’s then the highest expected outcome would be on the increasing FDI inflows from the trading partner. If its GNI per capita is lower than Indonesia's, then the highest foreseeable result would be on the rising net trade balance of Indonesia. Second, industrial sector incentive analysis by comparing RIA scores on all possible incentive policies. In this paper, the modified RIA found that firms prefer supply-side incentives such as government support on the Research and Development, patent and copyright protection than fiscal incentives such as the import duty-free or tariff rate protection.

K23|Diversifying Electricity Customer Choice: REVing Up the New York Energy Vision for Polycentric Innovation|Electric utility business models are changing to integrate new technologies and distributed energy resources (DER). Diversifying energy mix and customer choices are both novel and useful in understanding key drivers of this transformation, including distribution system planning and customer-service options. Practical implementation of these solutions, how- ever, shows that without proper planning, energy diversiication could come at very high social and economic costs. For example, regulators have been slow in implementing policy, regulatory, and business model constructs that promote customer choice to animate high levels of grid reliability and resiliency. Equally important is how viable existing utility business models are to navigating transformation processes, including strategic resource management, revenue model, customer interface, and value propositions. This chapter discusses our use of the Hamel business model to ofer strategic analysis of Reforming the Energy Vision (REV), which is aimed at decarbonizing New York’s energy sector and increasing customer choice and control. Speciically, we build from existing literature to argue that implementing distribution management systems (DMS) in which customer choice and DERs are prominent requires a shared or ‘polycentric,’ networked business- model innovations that build on competitive and comparative advantages of existing institutions to meet the growing demand for electricity services and utility strategic goals.

K23|Employers as personal data administrators – specifics and requirements in the context of the information society|The paper explores the specifics of the personal data administrator in the information society and the new European regulations. On the basis of the correlation between the digitization in the economy and the impact of the process on the labor relation, the basic obligations of the employer as data administrator are analyzed. Finally, conclusions and recommendations on the application of the regulations are made in view of the employer‘s commitments regarding the employees’ personal data.
K23|International Environmental Agreement and the Timing of Domestic Lobbying|We incorporate domestic lobbying activities into a policymaker's decision making on whether or not to sign a cooperative bilateral environmental agreement and, if not, how much pollution a country emits. There are environmental and industrial lobbyists who attempt to sway the policymaker's decision toward their respectively favored policies. As is usually the case with a common agency model, lobbyists present contribution schedules that are tied to resulting policy choices. In this article, we focus on the impacts of the timing of lobbying activities. The first type of lobbying occurs on the signing of a cooperative agreement, and the second when each nation chooses its own non-cooperative emission level after the agreement was not signed or one of the signatories has reneged on its promise. We compare the outcomes of the four different cases: (i) no lobbying activity; (ii) lobbying conducted at the agreement signing stage; (iii) lobbying conducted when non-cooperative choice is made; and (iv) lobbying at both occasions. Our results suggest that the different timings of domestic lobbying have quite contrasting impacts on the signing of a cooperative agreement, and also that increasing the number of lobbying opportunities can even contribute to the emergence of international cooperation.
K23|Do Agricultural Marketing Laws Matter for Rural Growth? Evidence from the Indian States|This article examines effects of the regulatory framework of post-harvest agricultural markets on agricultural growth across Indian states over the period 1970-2008. We propose a new measure that captures various legislative dimensions of a key ‘Act’ - the Agricultural Produce Markets Commission (APMC) Act and Rules - governing the agricultural markets, evolved from the dismal colonial history of India, and use this measure to estimate growth models using panel methods. We have applied Fixed-Effects, Feasible Generalized Least Squares, and Fixed-Effects Instrumental Variable models to the panel data to address the endogeneity associated with the regulatory framework. Our results show that the Act significantly promotes not only agricultural growth but the use and the adoption of agricultural technology. Evidence presented suggests that a policy to remove market regulation rather than advancing effective ones would fail consequentially to draw investments and improve agriculture growth.
K23|Entry deterrence due to brand proliferation: Empirical evidence from the German interurban bus industry|In 2016, the largest operator in the German interurban bus industry, Flixbus, acquired its major rival, Postbus. We study the effects of that takeover using route-level data covering more than 6,000 routes. We find that Flixbus, on average, provided a lower frequency of bus rides and slightly decreased prices after the takeover. This indicates that Flixbus pursued a strategy of preemption: to decrease residual demand for Postbus, Flixbus offered a high number of bus rides. After the takeover, Flixbus decreased the supply of transportation services and lowered the prices to compensate the consumers for the resulting increase in inconvenience costs.
K23|Sharing R&D Risk in Healthcare via FDA Hedges|The high cost of capital for firms conducting medical research and development (R&D) has been partly attributed to the government risk facing investors in medical innovation. This risk slows down medical innovation because investors must be compensated for it. We analyze new and simple financial instruments, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hedges, to allow medical R&D investors to better share the pipeline risk associated with FDA approval with broader capital markets. Using historical FDA approval data, we discuss the pricing of FDA hedges and mechanisms under which they can be traded and estimate issuer returns from offering them. Using various unique data sources, we find that FDA approval risk has a low correlation across drug classes as well as with other assets and the overall market. We argue that this zero-beta property of scientific FDA risk could be a main source of gains from trade between issuers of FDA hedges looking for diversified investments and developers looking to offload the FDA approval risk. We offer proof of concept of the feasibility of trading this type of pipeline risk by examining related securities issued around mergers and acquisitions activity in the drug industry. Overall, our argument is that, by allowing better risk sharing between those investing in medical innovation and capital markets more generally, FDA hedges could ultimately spur medical innovation and improve the health of patients.
K23|How Far Is Too Far? New Evidence on Abortion Clinic Closures, Access, and Abortions|We document the effects of abortion-clinic closures on clinic access, abortions, and births using variation generated by a law that shuttered nearly half of Texas' clinics. Increases in distance have significant effects for women initially living within 200 miles of a clinic. The largest effect is for those nearest to clinics for whom a 25-mile increase reduces abortion 10%. We also demonstrate the importance of congestion with a proxy capturing effects of closures which have little impact on distance but which reduce clinics per-capita. These effects account for 59% of the effects of clinic closures on abortion.
K23|Regulation of Charlatans in High-Skill Professions|We study a market for a skill that is in short supply and high demand, where the presence of charlatans (professionals who sell a service that they do not deliver on) is an equilibrium outcome. We use this model to evaluate the belief that reducing the number of charlatans through regulation increases consumer surplus. We show that this belief is false: both information disclosure as well as setting standards reduces consumer surplus. Although both standards and disclosure drive charlatans out of the market, consumers are worse off because of the resulting reduction in competition amongst producers. Producers, on the other hand, strictly benefit from the regulation, implying that the regulation we observe in these markets likely derives from producer interests. The model provides insights into the parameters that drive the cross-sectional variation in charlatans across professions. Professions with weak trade groups, skills in larger supply, shorter training periods and less informative signals regarding the professional's skill, are more likely to feature charlatans. We conclude that the number of charlatans in equilibrium is positively related to the value added of that profession to consumers.
K23|Optimal Regulation with Exemptions|Despite decades of research on mechanism design and on many practical aspects of cost-benefit analysis, one of the most basic and ubiquitous features of regulation as actually implemented throughout the world has received little theoretical attention: exemptions for small firms. These firms may generate a disproportionate share of harm due to their being exempt and because exemption induces additional harmful activity to be channeled their way. This article analyzes optimal regulation with exemptions where firms have different productivities that are unobservable to the regulator, regulated and unregulated output each cause harm although at different levels, and the regulatory regime affects entry as well as the output choices of regulated and unregulated firms. In many settings, optimal schemes involve subtle effects and have counterintuitive features: for example, higher regulatory costs need not favor higher exemptions, and the incentives of firms to drop output to become exempt can be too weak as well as too strong. A final section examines the optimal use of output taxation alongside regulation, which illustrates the contrast with the mechanism design approach that analyzes the optimal use of instruments of a type that are not in widespread use.
K23|The Diffusion of New Institutions: Evidence from Renaissance Venice's Patent System|What factors affect the diffusion of new economic institutions? This paper examines this question exploiting the introduction of the first regularized patent system which appeared in the Venetian Republic in 1474. We begin by developing a model which links patenting activity of craft guilds with provisions in their statutes. The model predicts that guild statutes that are more effective at preventing outsider's entry and at mitigating price competition lead to less patenting. We test this prediction on a new dataset which combines detailed information on craft guilds and patents in the Venetian Republic during the Renaissance. We find a negative association between patenting activity and guild statutory norms which strongly restrict entry and price competition. We show that guilds which originated from medieval religious confraternities were more likely to regulate entry and competition, and that the effect on patenting is robust to instrumenting guild statutes with their quasi-exogenous religious origin. We also find that patenting was more widespread among guilds geographically distant from Venice, and among guilds in cities with lower political connection which we measure exploiting a new database on noble families and their marriages with members of the great council. Our analysis suggests that local economic and political conditions may have a substantial impact on the diffusion of new economic institutions.
K23|The balance between investor protection and the right to regulate in investment treaties: A scoping paper|There is vigorous debate about reforms to address the balance between investor protection and the right to regulate in the over 3000 existing investment treaties. This paper first notes the growing trend to analyse particular treaty rules rather than treaties as a whole and the importance of comparative analysis of balancing under other regimes. It then outlines issues in four areas: (i) the types of regulation potentially at issue in investment treaty claims by covered investors; (ii) the types and levels of investor protection; (iii) the degree of impact of treaties on regulation; and (iv) the processes and institutions that may be involved in balancing interests in investor protection and the right to regulate. While the paper recognises that dispute resolution institutions have a significant impact on the balance and the right to regulate, it focuses primarily on substantive issues in light of other ongoing work on dispute settlement.
K23|Addressing the balance of interests in investment treaties: The limitation of fair and equitable treatment provisions to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law|The fair and equitable treatment (FET) provision has leapt to prominence in the last 15 years as the principal ground of liability at issue in many if not most investment treaty arbitration claims. In debates about the impact of investment treaties on the right to regulate, FET is second only to investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) as the most-cited provision. This paper examines government action to address the balance between investor protection and the right to regulate by limiting fair and equitable treatment provisions to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law (MST-FET). The paper reviews the distinction between MST-FET clauses and autonomous FET clauses, and notes growing use of an express MST-FET approach in many regions. NAFTA governments’ views about the nature of the MST-FET standard, how it is identified, and its content are then examined in detail. An initial focus on NAFTA, while limited, is justified due to many singularities in NAFTA, including numerous government interpretations of MST-FET since 1994, their availability to the public and the comparatively higher success rate of NAFTA governments in defending FET claims. The paper concludes with brief comparisons between the government views and the views of ISDS tribunals and commentators.
K23|Adjudicator Compensation Systems and Investor-State Dispute Settlement|Compensation for adjudicators is generally considered as a core issue for judicial independence and for attracting good judges in the institutional design for courts. This paper examines compensation systems for adjudicators and dispute settlement administrators in investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). The paper uses in part a comparative perspective based on approaches in domestic courts in advanced economies, an approach rarely taken in analysing investor-state arbitration.The first section of the paper provides historical context and examines the reform of remuneration of judges to replace private litigant fees with salaries in colonial America and the United States, France and England in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Subsequent sections address debates over the impact of compensation systems on adjudicators; contemporary approaches to the compensation of judges in advanced economies; the co-existence in advanced economies of national courts with salaried judges since the early 19th century with generally strong support for commercial arbitration based on ad hoc fee-based remuneration; and similarities and differences between commercial arbitration and investment arbitration, focusing how the largely similar compensation systems may have different effects and be differently perceived by the public.Annexes to the paper report on discussions about adjudicator compensation at the 2016 OECD Investment Treaty Conference and gather some preliminary facts about adjudicator and dispute administrator compensation in investor-state arbitration as well as the investment court system included in the recent EU-Canada CETA trade and investment agreement.
K23|Private Equity Fund Structures in Czech Republic within the Framework of the New Institutional Economics|Research background: Institutional aspects of a well-functioning private equity and venture capital market are emphasized in the recent academic literature. In particular, a favourable tax and legal environment is essential, since formal institutions enable the industry to attract a larger volume of investors and thus to contribute more efficiently to the growth of GDP. In the Czech Republic, however, legal barriers represent an essential obstacle affecting a rather poor scope of resources available to domestic private equity and venture capital funds. Purpose of the article: This paper examines the current tax and legal environment for private equity and venture capital investments in the Czech/ Republic. Proposals for prospective improvements of legal and tax framework are made in the empirical part of the study. Methodology/methods: As the phenomenon under study is complex and explanatory in nature, qualitative data with content analysis proved to be the best way how to assess institutional framework for PE/VC in the Czech Republic. Data collection methods cover a comparative analysis of scientific literature documents and reports, as well as primary data from interviews with experts in the industry. The results of both secondary and primary data analysis were categorized and core lacks in the institutional framework were identified and discussed. Finally, proposals for prospective improvements of the institutional framework are made. Findings & Value added: The conducted analysis implies that the issue of the legal and organisational structure suitable for PE/VC funds may be deemed resolved in the Czech Republic. A Czech equivalent to a Limited Partnership (SICAR), i.e. a limited partnership with investment certificates, has already with provided with sufficient support in the legislation in terms of the legal form. The legal form is a necessary, yet not sufficient condition. A tax handicap was identified implying that it is necessary to amend the tax law so that the legal regulation extends the tax exemption. Another amendment to the applicable legislation should then be directed towards eliminating or mitigating the barriers imposed on pension funds when investing in PE/VC funds.

K23|Forming Of Local Budgets: Between Fiscal Decentralization And Social Solidarity|Financial decentralization is an essential part of the administrative and financial decentralization process, because it represents the most important source that fuels the public budgets. The transfer of administrative competences from the center towards the periphery, meaning from the central public administration to the local ones, must be accompanied by the increase of the local budget revenues, which is in direct dependence of financial decentralization, by increasing the amount of taxes entering the local budgets (without increasing the tax burden). Increasing the local budget revenues is also possible by allocation of additional amounts from the national budget, but this doesn’t represent a real decentralization, rather a disguised centralization, where the state decides how much, from where and under what form they are allocated to the local authorities, and this last one is in a continuous uncertainty and dependency to the center. This study proposes a modern conception on the financial decentralization in Romania, in accordance with the majority of the direct financial revenues (income tax and profit tax) that must enter in the budget of the localities, from where these will turn – in order to respect the financial equality and solidarity principle – odds to the county budget and to the state budget.
K23|Insolvency Of Administrative Territorial Units - Are The Principles Of Public Law Fully Compatible With The Requirements Of An Effective Management?|The European states have introduced the mechanism of administrative territorial units (ATU) insolvency due to the influence of American law, US being the first state that recognized in 1934 the cities insolvency by Bankruptcy Act, as an answer to the financial crisis of the 1930s. Romania introduced it in two steps. Firstly, by the Law no. 273/2006 regarding local public finances. The procedure described by this law made it practically impossible to apply it, as the public law doctrine emphasized it. Secondly, by the Government Emergency Ordinance (GOU) no. 46/2013 that changed the previous law. Even if many authors emphasized the necessity of such a regulation, the results of its application are rather modest. Many ATU does not want to declare to be in financial crisis, even if the GOU no. 46/2013 describes sanctions that may be applied for non-declaring. The atomization of the local public administration - by the emergence of an impressive number of ATU without an impact study - aggravated the functioning of the administration at the local level. This atomization has not been remedied by the introduction of the TAU insolvency mechanism.
K23|The Opportunities and Challenges Overview: Implementing Performance Based Standards Regulation for High Capacity Passenger Vehicle in Malaysia|Road accidents involving heavy commercial passenger vehicle (HCPV) in Malaysia have always been in the spotlight and various efforts have been taken with much attention given on operational issues. At present, the weight and dimensions of HCPV in Malaysia generally regulated under prescriptive standards regulations which do not provide clear safety outcomes and often limits the flexibility about how to achieve it. This paper provides an overview of opportunities and challenges of implementing Performance Based Standards (PBS) regulation for HCPV vehicle in Malaysia based on the Australian PBS regulation implementation for heavy vehicle. It was found that Tail Swing, Braking Efficiency and Maximum Stable Inclination Angle under the existing regulation have or partly met the PBS approach. The opportunities for implementing PBS regulation were explained in terms of the possibility adopting PBS approaches in the existing regulation and second, the institutional readiness to develop and implement it. However, challenges were expected, for example increase in cost of vehicle’s assessment. Implementing PBS regulation for HCPV in Malaysia will provide various benefits such as increase productivity, efficiency and most importantly safety.
K23|The Amazon Monopoly: Is Amazon’s Private Label Business the Tipping Point?|The purpose of this paper is to consider if Amazon’s increase in private label brands is the tipping point for transforming the e-commerce giant into a monopoly. To lay the foundation, we initially explore the culture, leadership, and business practices which are unique to Amazon that enabled the company to become one of the U.S.’s largest and fastest growing e-commerce websites. Introduced in 2009, Amazon’s private label business has further propelled Amazon’s growth while creating a competitive advantage for the company by offering high quality products to their customers at low cost options. In considering whether private label brands affect Amazon’s status as a monopoly, we first examine exactly what a monopoly is and if Amazon can be classified as one in its current state. We then take a deep dive into Amazon’s private label strategy, analyzing past performance to make educated assumptions about the future. Our research provided evidence indicating that Amazon’s actions are threatening the cooperative nature of its Marketplace by creating substantial barriers to entry and increasing Amazon’s market share. With this knowledge we make predictions about Amazon’s future and whether it will ever be seen as a monopoly under the economic, legal, and/or social definitions. While Amazon’s case is unprecedented, this paper sources leading economists, journalists, and other academic research to support our theory.

K23|Trade Agreements, Regulatory Sovereignty and Democratic Legitimacy|Governments increasingly are seeking to use bilateral and regional trade agreements to reduce the cost-increasing effects of differences in product market regulation. They also pursue regulatory cooperation independent of trade agreements. It is important to understand what is being done through bilateral or plurilateral mechanisms to address regulatory differences, and to identify what, if any, role trade agreements can play in supporting international regulatory cooperation. This paper reflects on experience to date in regulatory cooperation and the provisions of recent trade agreements involving advanced economies that have included regulatory cooperation. We argue for a re-thinking by trade officials of the modalities and design of trade negotiations and the incorporation of institutional mechanisms that draw on insights of experimentalist governance approaches to enhance the scope for international regulatory cooperation.
K23|A Legal Lethal Education|In the 1930s, the United States was a global leader in public education by having the largest student populations in the world attend high schools. In the 1980s, school shootings started escalating in the United States, as did profitable investing in the privatization of American prisons, which currently contain half of the world?s total prison population of 233 countries. In the 2000s, adversarial laws related constitutionality and impartiality but not resolve for why the United States is where the majority of the world?s prison population resides and massive school shootings. There has been debate of whether a correlation authentically or paradoxically exists. There has been debate of why random school shootings cannot be predetermined by traditional means of profiling or quasi-experimental research, which are two rudiments viably debated as predispositions contributing to high imprisonment in America. There has been debate that penal populations and school massacres may decrease if judicial practices are less politicized, popularized, and localized. While well intended, the decades of debates distract from definite resolve. The American dream of equal access to education in the pursuit of liberty and happiness is a civil right in a nation of exceptionally high imprisonment and indiscriminate school massacres. Resident and nonresident aliens in the United States are not the primary populations of prisoners because native-born citizens conduct the majority of crimes and school massacres in America. Disadvantaged individuals who are young, poor, minorities, and uneducated immensely compile prison populations in the United States. However, in American school massacres, disadvantaged or advantaged individuals can equally and effortlessly become defenseless instructors or deceased students. The contrast is alarming and a foundation to propose the United States Department of Education, which administrates legal regulations and policies for American schools, permit defensive mandatory practices to help foster educational excellence through safety in schools. The proposal merits substantial review due to administrative laws as a necessity in the governance of society, or due to the likely fact that from the time this content is written to the time this content is published and read, another deadly school shooting will occur in the United States.

K23|Algorithmes de prix, intelligence artificielle et équilibres collusifs|Algorithmic pricing can help competitors to collude. Big Data, real-time pricing, and predictive analysis can allow a tacit collusion agreement and a durable equilibrium to be reached quickly. Artificial intelligence poses a specific challenge because the algorithm may autonomously discover the possible gains associated with this kind of non-aggression agreement and also because it is particularly difficult to analyse its decision-making process. Hence sanctioning this on the grounds of prohibiting anti-competitive practices is not straightforward. This paper explores the alternative ways of regulation, through audits or the implementation of liability rules. JEL Codes: K21, K24, L41
K23|Asymmetric information as a barrier to knowledge spillovers in expert markets|Abstract This paper investigates barriers to effective knowledge spillovers for markets in which the product can be characterized as a credence good, i.e. its complexity impedes the evaluation of quality by customers both ex-ante and ex-post. We focus on the German market for energy efficiency consultants, as an emerging and subsidized sector in which the service offered has strong credence good properties. Based upon in-depth interviews with stakeholders, we analyze the determinants and barriers to knowledge spillovers. We find that the incentive to foster spillovers to increase suppliers’ knowledge is limited by the difficult commercialization of additional capabilities. The implementation of a public certification scheme has failed to increase the sectoral knowledge spillovers. By contrast, the participation in formal knowledge networks has been more effective in prompting companies to foster knowledge spillovers, which has also led to a higher degree of specialization. We conclude that access to certification schemes should be further restricted to increase market transparency and private networks should be supported to achieve the aim of increasing knowledge spillovers.
K23|Was bringt die Anreizregulierung „2.1“?<BR>[What Will “Incentive Regulation 2.1” Deliver?]|Zusammenfassung Nach langer Abstimmungszeit wurde eine Reform der Anreizregulierungsverordnung in Deutschland verabschiedet.

Die Novelle sollte vor allem die Investitionsbedingungen verbessern und stellt einen Schwenk zu einem deutlich stärker kostenorientierten System dar.
K23|Patent Validity Challenges and The America Invents Act|Patent reexamination or patent review systems can lower the cost of challenging patent validity and help improve patent quality. We empirically investigate post-grant patent validity challenges at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and how the 2011 America Invents Act affected them. We compare the inter partes reexamination with the inter partes review procedure that replaced it after the reform. To identify the effect of the policy changes, we exploit the fact that patents filed before the act passed, but granted after the new inter partes review system took effect, are not eligible for reexamination in the old system. We find that more patent challenges end with a patentee win after the policy change. Still, at least one patent claim is canceled in more than 60% of the cases. Challenged patents issued to small entities more often had at least one claim canceled compared to other patents.
K23|Gli incentivi allâ€™efficienza energetica nelle Gare per il Servizio di Distribuzione Gas: riflessi di Finanza Pubblica Locale|This paper provides timely and updated analysis of the role of incentives to energy efficiency, namely to investments efficiency improving, conveyed through the â€œwhite certificate systemâ€ or â€œenergy efficiency certificatesâ€ against annual obligations that fall at the expense of natural gas distributor. Are analyzed the ways of performance of the obligation to purchase and the role played in this matter by the institutional players (GME, GSE, AEEGSI, Ministry of Economic Development). The analysis is therefore developed on the subject of â€œadditional energy efficiency certificatesâ€ that competitors (bidders) in the race for the award of natural gas distribution service can offer to Municipalities hanging in â€œMinimum Territorial Areaâ€ (ATEM) and on the fallout that such minimum offer has in the â€œFinancial Planâ€ prepared by competitor in support of his offer. Finally the authors analyze some problems and critical aspects of the system and made synthetically any proposal to eliminate them.
K23|An Overview of Sports Betting Regulation in the United States|The United States employs an ad hoc, unconventional method of regulating sports betting, banning it almost everywhere while granting a monopoly to firms in a single state, Nevada. This approach encourages illegal sports betting markets, ignores negative externalities, and generates welfare losses among the large population of responsible recreational gamblers. I review the current state of sports betting regulation in the U.S. and assess its economic viability in advance of the Supreme Court of the United States decision on the landmark Christie v. National Collegiate Athletic Association case.
K23|Knowledge spillovers and absorptive capacity - institutional evidence from the 'German Mittelstand'|Recent extensions to the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship (KSTE) show that the successful commercialization of new knowledge by incumbents depends on their absorptive capacities. For policy-makers focusing on increasing incumbents' innovative performance, the systematic reduction of knowledge filter through improved absorptive capacities thus becomes a crucial goal. While the general working mechanisms of knowledge filter have been analyzed within the KSTE framework, few institutional solutions to increase absorptive capacities have been put forth. This study provides an initial case study explaining a specific institutional framework fostering the systematic penetration of knowledge filters by incumbent firms in the case of German SMEs. Using a set of 177 in-depth interviews with firm representatives, the system of interrelated organizations, institutional arrangements, shared values and economic incentives associated with the institutional structures for knowledge spillovers for German SMEs are described. I identify institutional characteristics connected to the dual system of vocational training, regulatory measures and economic incentives mutually enforcing and fostering broad knowledge spillovers. This exploratory approach enables deriving hypotheses for the further study of knowledge filters as well as policy implications for the design of institutions increasing incumbents' absorptive capacities.
K23|Funders-of-Last-Resort: Legal Issues Involved in Using Central Bank Balance Sheets to Bolster Economic Growth|What role does unconventional monetary policy – and particularly unconventional policies like private asset purchases under a quantitative easing or lender of last resort scheme – play in influencing economic growth directly? Emerging and developing countries’ central banks could contribute to GDP growth by following the example of jurisdiction like the US, UK and EU, by buying private sector and specific obligation public sector assets. Such a scheme would like most benefit jurisdictions like Greece, Bulgaria, Ukraine and others. Unsurprisingly, we find a weak relationship between these purchases and investment world-wide for the last 10 years. We also find the existence of a “sloth effect” – a pattern in the data whereby more central bank asset purchases actually coincides with lower investment. We estimate the gains to increasing central bank balance sheet sizes with these assets. We also show how statutory mandate for nominal GDP targeting set the best legal foundations for such asset purchases. We finally describe an internal audit engagement which would collect the specific data needed to verify the results in this study.
K23|Betriebliche Ausbildungsbeteiligung ‐ eine veränderte Anreizkonstellation durch die Handwerksnovelle 2004?|Mit der Untersuchung von Koch/Nielen (2016/2017) liegt erstmals eine Kausalanalyse zu den ausbildungsseitigen Effekten der Handwerksnovelle 2004 vor. Der vorliegende Beitrag diskutiert die diesbezüglichen Kernergebnisse. Auf Basis eines alternativen Interpretationsansatzes wird versucht, einen vermeintlichen Widerspruch der Studie aufzuklären. Auf dieser Grundlage lassen die Ergebnisse von Koch/Nielen (2016/2017) darauf schließen, dass die Reform negative Effekte auf das handwerkliche Ausbildungsgeschehen gehabt haben dürfte. Vor allem trifft dies für den zulassungsfrei gestellten Teil der Handwerkswirtschaft zu. Besonders zum Tragen kommt hier die starke Zunahme des Anteils nicht-ausbildungsaktiver Ein-Personen-Unternehmen. Der Beitrag macht deutlich, dass die Handwerksnovelle wahrscheinlich jedoch auch im zulassungspflichtig gebliebenen Teil des Handwerks negativ auf das Ausbildungsgeschehen gewirkt hat. Ursache ist eine veränderte Anreizkonstellation im zulassungspflichtigen Handwerk, weil dort die Berufszulassung aufgrund der Reform nicht mehr automatisch an eine Ausbildungsberechtigung gekoppelt ist. In der Summe lassen die Ergebnisse von Koch/Nielen (2016/2017) daher vermuten, dass sich die handwerkliche Ausbildungsleistung aufgrund der Handwerksnovelle 2004 verringert hat.
K23|Too Complex to Work: A Critical Assessment of the Bail-in Tool under the European Bank Recovery and Resolution Regime|This article analyses the bail-in tool under the European Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and predicts that it will not reach its policy objective. To make this argument, this article first describes the policy rationale that calls for mandatory private sector involvement (PSI). From this analysis the key features for an effective bail-in tool can be derived. These insights serve as the background to make the case that the European resolution framework is likely ineffective in establishing adequate market discipline through risk-reflecting prices for bank capital. The main reason for this lies in the avoidable embeddedness of the BRRD’s bail-in tool in the much broader resolution process which entails ample discretion of the authorities also in forcing PSI. Moreover, the idea that nearly all positions on the liability side of a bank’s balance sheet should be subjected to bail-in is misguided. Instead, a concentration of PSI in instruments that fall under the minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) is preferable. Finally, this article synthesizes the prior analysis by putting forward an alternative regulatory approach that seeks to disentangle PSI as a precondition for effective bank-resolution as much as possible from the resolution process as such.
K23|Why MREL won't help much|The bail-in tool as implemented in the European bank resolution framework suffers from severe shortcomings. To some extent, the regulatory framework can remedy the impediments to the desirable incentive effect of private sector involvement (PSI) that emanate from a lack of predictability of outcomes, if it compels banks to issue a sufficiently sized minimum of high-quality, easy to bail-in (subordinated) liabilities. Yet, even the limited improvements any prescription of bail-in capital can offer for PSI's operational effectiveness seem compromised in important respects. The main problem, echoing the general concerns voiced against the European bail-in regime, is that the specifications for minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) are also highly detailed and discretionary and thus alleviate the predicament of investors in bail-in debt, at best, only insufficiently. Quite importantly, given the character of typical MREL instruments as non-runnable long-term debt, even if investors are able to gauge the relevant risk of PSI in a bank's failure correctly at the time of purchase, subsequent adjustment of MREL-prescriptions by competent or resolution authorities potentially change the risk profile of the pertinent instruments. Therefore, original pricing decisions may prove inadequate and so may market discipline that follows from them. The pending European legislation aims at an implementation of the already complex specifications of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) for Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) by very detailed and case specific amendments to both the regulatory capital and the resolution regime with an exorbitant emphasis on proportionality and technical fine-tuning. What gets lost in this approach, however, is the key policy objective of enhanced market discipline through predictable PSI: it is hardly conceivable that the pricing of MREL-instruments reflects an accurate risk-assessment of investors because of the many discretionary choices a multitude of agencies are supposed to make and revisit in the administration of the new regime. To prove this conclusion, this chapter looks in more detail at the regulatory objectives of the BRRD's prescriptions for MREL and their implementation in the prospectively amended European supervisory and resolution framework.
K23|More than Words: A global analysis of the socio-economic impact of Rich Interaction Applications (RIAs)|Applications such as iMessage, KakaoTalk, LINE, Signal, Skype, Snapchat, Threema, Viber, WhatsApp and WeChat have become an increasingly popular means of personal and business interaction. Surprisingly little academic effort has gone into understanding the nature and origin of these applications, yet. Policy makers and regulators on the other hand have developed pragmatic definitions of a group of applications that mimic functions of traditional Electronic Communications Services (ECS). Our paper explores whether this approach gives proper consideration to these applications’ nature. Based on our indicative framework for delineating them from other OTT services, we use econometric modelling to approximate their global economic impact. We find that any static definition of these applications is bound to fall short of reality within a few months due their rapid innovation cycle. Nonetheless, we are able to identify functions that enable rich interactions among consumers and businesses as the common thread of 139 applications that we analysed. Thus, we sum them under the banner of Rich Interaction Applications (RIAs). Their constant innovation implies that they develop from baseline communications channels to applications that offer an increasingly large part of a ‘full internet experience’. With this in mind, our analysis places their economic impact between baseline telecommunications services’ and the internet’ impact. For a 10% increase in RIAs usage GDP for the 164 countries in our panel rises by 0.33% based on the years 2000 to 2015. In sum, policy makers and regulators ought to strive for framework conditions that enable or even better facilitate innovation as well as dynamic competition. Ultimately, these are the ingredients for realizing the largest benefits for consumers and the economy.
K23|Evaluation der Mietpreisbremse|Getrieben durch den starken Zuzug aus dem In- und Ausland erleben die Wohnungsmärkte der deutschen Metropolregionen in den letzten Jahren einen deutlichen Nachfrageschub. Durch die gleichzeitig nur moderat ausgeweitete Bautätigkeit fällt es Mietern zunehmend schwerer bezahlbaren Wohnraum zu finden. Im Nachgang der Bundestagswahl 2013 ist das Problem der sich verschärfenden Wohnungs-knappheit auf der politischen Agenda der deutschen Bundesregierung gelandet, mit dem Ziel, Wohnraum auch zukünftig für die breite Bevölkerung bezahlbar zu halten. Mit dem 1. Juni 2015 wurde dann das Wohnungsmarktinstrument der Mietpreisbremse - zunächst in Berlin - eingeführt, um überdurchschnittlichen Mietpreiserhöhungen entgegenzuwirken. Mit einigen Ausnahmen für neu errichtete und umfassend modernisierte Wohnungen darf seitdem die geforderte Neuvertragsmiete die jeweilige orts-übliche Vergleichsmiete um maximal zehn Prozent überschreiten. Jedoch scheint der Anstieg der Mieten trotz der Einführung der Wohnungsmarktregulierung ungebrochen, sodass in Öffentlichkeit und Medien zunehmend Zweifel an der Wirksamkeit der Mietpreisbremse aufgekommen sind.

K23|Five years after the Liikanen Report: What have we learned?|The publication of the Liikanen Group's final report in October 2012 was surrounded by high expectations regarding the implementation of the reform plans through the proposed measures that reacted to the financial and sovereign debt crises. The recommendations mainly focused on introducing a mild version of banking separation and the creation of the preconditions for bail-in measures. In this article, we present an overview of the regulatory reforms, to which the financial sector has been subject over the past years in accordance with the concepts laid out in the Liikanen Report. It becomes clear from our assessment that more specific steps have yet to be taken before the agenda is accomplished. In particular, bail-in rules must be implemented more consistently. Beyond the question of the required minimum, the authors develop the notion of a maximum amount of liabilities subject to bail-in. The combination of both components leads to a three-layer structure of bank capital: a bail-in tranche, a deposit-insured bailout tranche, and an intermediate run-endangered mezzanine tranche. The size and treatment of the latter must be put to a political debate that weighs the costs and benefits of a further increase in financial stability beyond that achieved through loss-bearing of the bail-in tranche.
K23|Why MREL won't help much: Minimum requirements for bail-in capital as insufficient remedy for defunct private sector involvement under the European bank resolution framework|The bail-in tool as implemented in the European bank resolution framework suffers from severe shortcomings. To some extent, the regulatory framework can remedy the impediments to the desirable incentive effect of private sector involvement (PSI) that emanate from a lack of predictability of outcomes, if it compels banks to issue a sufficiently sized minimum of high-quality, easy to bail-in (subordinated) liabilities. Yet, even the limited improvements any prescription of bail-in capital can offer for PSI's operational effectiveness seem compromised in important respects. The main problem, echoing the general concerns voiced against the European bail-in regime, is that the specifications for minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) are also highly detailed and discretionary and thus alleviate the predicament of investors in bail-in debt, at best, only insufficiently. Quite importantly, given the character of typical MREL instruments as non-runnable long-term debt, even if investors are able to gauge the relevant risk of PSI in a bank's failure correctly at the time of purchase, subsequent adjustment of MREL-prescriptions by competent or resolution authorities potentially change the risk profile of the pertinent instruments. Therefore, original pricing decisions may prove inadequate and so may market discipline that follows from them. The pending European legislation aims at an implementation of the already complex specifications of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) for Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) by very detailed and case specific amendments to both the regulatory capital and the resolution regime with an exorbitant emphasis on proportionality and technical fine-tuning. What gets lost in this approach, however, is the key policy objective of enhanced market discipline through predictable PSI: it is hardly conceivable that the pricing of MREL-instruments reflects an accurate risk-assessment of investors because of the many discretionary choices a multitude of agencies are supposed to make and revisit in the administration of the new regime. To prove this conclusion, this chapter looks in more detail at the regulatory objectives of the BRRD's prescriptions for MREL and their implementation in the prospectively amended European supervisory and resolution framework.
K23|Remarks on the German Regulation of Crowdfunding|Crowdfunding is a buzzword that signifies a sub-set in the new forms of finance facilitated by advances in information technology usually categorized as fintech. Concerns for financial stability, investor and consumer protection, or the prevention of money laundering or funding of terrorism hinge incrementally on including the new techniques to initiate financing relationships adequately in the regulatory framework. This paper analyzes the German regulation of crowdinvesting and finds that it does not fully live up to the regulatory challenges posed by this novel form of digitized matching of supply and demand on capital markets. It should better reflect the key importance of crowdinvesting platforms, which may become critical providers of market infrastructure in the not too distant future. Moreover, platforms can play an important role in investor protection that cannot be performed by traditional disclosure regimes geared towards more seasoned issuers. Against this background, the creation of an exemption from the traditional prospectus regime seems to be a plausible policy choice. However, it needs to be complemented by an adequate regulatory stimulation of platforms' role as gatekeepers.
K23|Regulation of crowdfunding in Germany|This paper is the national report for Germany prepared for the to the 20th General Congress of the International Academy of Comparative Law 2018 and gives an overview of the regulation of crowdfunding in Germany and the typical design of crowdfunding campaigns under this legal framework. After a brief survey of market data, it delineates the classification of crowdfunding transactions in German contract law and their treatment under the applicable conflict of laws regime. It then turns to the relevant rules in prudential banking regulation and capital market law. It highlights disclosure requirements that flow from both contractual obligations of the initiators of campaigns vis-à-vis contributors and securities regulation (prospectus regime). After sketching the most important duties of the parties involved in crowdfunding, the report also looks at the key features of the respective transactions' tax treatment.
K23|Power Politics: Electoral Cycles in German Electricity Prices|We provide evidence that German public energy providers, over which municipality-level politicians hold substantial sway, systematically adjust the pricing of electric energy in response to local electoral cycles. The documented pattern is in line with both, an artificial reduction in prices before an election that needs to be countermanded by future price increases, and an artificial postponement of market-driven price increases until after the election is over.
K23|Patterns of entry and exit in the deregulated German interurban bus industry|We study patterns of entry and exit in the German interurban bus industry in the first three years after its deregulation in January 2013. Using a comprehensive data set of all firm and route entries and exits, we find that the industry grew much quicker than originally expected – with particularly a few new entrants being most successful in quickly extending their route networks from regional to national coverage. Although the clear majority of routes is operated on a monopoly basis, competition does play a key role on routes with a sufficiently large base of (potential) customers. From a spatial perspective, three years after deregulation, the entire interurban bus network connects 60 percent of all 644 larger German cities – with the intensity of entry being dependent on the number of inhabitants, average income, the share of under 24 years old and the presence of intermodal competition by intercity railway services.
K23|Regulatory protective measures and risky behavior: Evidence from ice hockey|We provide evidence supporting the Peltzman effect, by which individuals required to wear protective gear end up taking additional risks that potentially offset the intended aim of the device. We take advantage of the fact that wearing a visor—a protective device in Ice Hockey—is mandatory in European, minor, and junior leagues but not in the NHL. This allows us to estimate the impact of wearing a visor by comparing the behavior in the NHL and other leagues of players who always wear a visor with that of players who wear one only when it is required. We find that when players are forced to wear a visor their behavior becomes more risky, earning an additional 0.19 penalty in minutes per game (compared to the average 1.14 penalty in minutes in our sample). We estimate an even larger effect of visors when we focus on players who were forced to use one during the 2004 season, when the NHL canceled its regular season and players had to move to European leagues temporarily. These estimates are not driven by players' observable attributes, playing style, or other differences across leagues.
K23|The principle of subsidiarity and centripetal forces: 14 years of application of the 2001 Italian constitutional reform|The 2001 reform made profound changes to the Italian Constitution, which led to a broad transfer of legislative powers from the State to the regions. The paper analyses the division of legislative powers introduced in 2001 from two points of view: i) consistency with the indications of economic literature; and ii) the effect on the functioning of the institutional system. In some cases the changes enacted in 2001 do not seem to meet efficiency criteria. Regarding the effects on the institutional system, the reform does not appear to have had an impact on the amount of laws approved at the regional level. However, there was a substantial increase in litigation between the State and the regions before the Constitutional Court. Moreover, the decisions of the Constitutional Court have tended to circumscribe the exercise of regional legislative powers in order to ensure uniform rules and a homogeneous level of protection throughout the country.
K23|Scope of Maximum Interest Rate Regulations (Report of Workshops (1))|"Statutory provisions regulating maximum interest rates (referred to generally hereafter as ""maximum interest rate regulations"") employ words that are interpreted to include various payments to creditors such as ""fees"" in addition to ""interest in substance"" (i.e. ""compensation for the use of principal""). Although this is considered effective in preventing evasion of regulation, it may have the effect of including payments made by parties to financial transactions without any intention to evade these regulations. The Report of the Workshops on ""Contemporary Financial Transactions and Their Regulatory Treatment"" (2016) (the ""Report"") explores this issue with regard to the interpretation of relevant laws and legislative actions. The Report refers to economics discourses related to maximum interest rate regulations and clarifies the intent and purpose of such regulations."
K23|Banking Business and Fund Transfer Transactions: Scope of Bank Regulation (Report of Workshops (2))|"In Japan, performing fund transfer transactions without a license or registration is subject to criminal sanctions. As the interpretation of the definition of fund transfer transactions has not been clearly established, there may be chilling effects on the development of innovative settlement and payment services. The Report of the Workshops on ""Contemporary Financial Transactions and Their Regulatory Treatment"" (2016) (the ""Report"") reviews the intent and purpose of bank regulation, and suggests an approach to determining whether or not a transaction constitutes a fund transfer transaction by properly interpreting its definition, using a collection agency service as a point of reference for legal analysis. The Report also provides a perspective for further discussion on how to implement new legislation with respect to the regulation of fund transfer transactions."
K23|Scope of Re-hypothecation Regulation (Report of Workshops (3))|"The margin requirements for non-cleared over-the-counter (""OTC"") derivatives transactions are introduced in 2016 (pursuant to an international agreement by the G20 to reduce systemic risk from OTC derivatives) and restrict the re-hypothecation of initial margin collateral. While this restriction is introduced in order to protect client assets, there has been a concern that such restriction may have a negative impact on market liquidity. The Report of the Workshops on ""Contemporary Financial Transactions and Their Regulatory Treatment"" (2016) (the ""Report"") analyzes the appropriate scope of regulation in relation to the re-hypothecation of initial margin collateral. Japan implements this regulation in a manner compatible with the international agreement, and introduces a new trust scheme concept, which allows for the segregated management of collateral assets. The Report also analyzes the potential for the trust scheme, which could provide room for the re-hypothecation of securities and hence, mitigate the unintended negative impact on market liquidity, while ensuring harmonization with the international agreement."
K23|Are the Risk Weights of Banks in the Czech Republic Procyclical? Evidence from Wavelet Analysis|We analyze the cyclicality of risk weights of banks in the Czech Republic from 2008 to 2016. We differentiate between risk weights under the internal ratings-based and those under the standardized approach, consider both the business cycle and the financial cycle, and employ wavelet coherence as a means of dynamic correlation analysis. Our results indicate that the risk weights of exposures under the internal ratings-based approach, including risk weights related to exposures secured by real estate collateral, are procyclical with respect to the financial cycle. We also show that the effect of changing asset quality on risk weights is present for the internal ratings-based approach, in line with our expectations based on regulatory standards. Our results can be employed for the purposes of decision-making on the activation of supervisory and macroprudential instruments, including the countercyclical capital buffer.
K23|Public-private partnership as an alternative source of financing of public tasks|Aim: The paper touches upon the issue of public-private partnership (PPP) as an alternative form of realising public tasks by the local authorities (Polish short: JST) in Poland. Motivation: Since 2009, the cooperation between the public and private sector has been used to an increasingly large extent in various areas of economy. The first part of the paper presents the legislation concerning the public-private partnership in Poland for the years 2009–2014 that regulates, defines and details the cooperation between both sectors. In order to present the scale of using the private-public partnership framework by local authorities in Poland, the last part of the text analyses reports originating from the Ministry of Economy, Polish Agency for Enterprise Development and the Public-Private Partnership Institute concerning the public-private partnership industry and concessions in Poland for the years 2009–2014. Results: Analysis of data and its interpretation were used in order to set out the perspectives for the development of the private-public partnership industry in Poland for future years. The statutory obligation to realise local authorities’ own tasks, combined with the limited amount of budget resources, forces the local authorities to look for alternative solutions. In the light of the analyses presented here, the public-private partnership framework may become a solution for the scarcity of financial resources for many communes, poviates and regions in Poland.
K23|The Diffusion of New Institutions: Evidence from Renaissance Venice's Patent System|What factors affect the diffusion of new economic institutions? This paper examines this question exploiting the introduction of the first regularized patent system which appeared in the Venetian Republic in 1474. We begin by developing a model which links patenting activity of craft guilds with provisions in their statutes. The model predicts that guild statutes that are more effective at preventing outsider’s entry and at mitigating price competition lead to less patenting. We test this prediction on a new dataset which combines detailed information on craft guilds and patents in the Venetian Republic during the Renaissance. We find a negative association between patenting activity and guild statutory norms which strongly restrict entry and price competition. We show that guilds which originated from medieval religious confraternities were more likely to regulate entry and competition, and that the effect on patenting is robust to instrumenting guild statutes with their quasi-exogenous religious origin. We also find that patenting was more widespread among guilds geographically distant from Venice, and among guilds in cities with lower political connection which we measure exploiting a new database on noble families and their marriages with members of the great council. Our analysis suggests that local economic and political conditions may have a substantial impact on the diffusion of new economic institutions.
K23|"Neoliberalism and Regulatory Capitalism: Understanding the ""Freer Markets More Rules"" Puzzle"|"Over the past four decades, across the OECD countries and beyond, we observe a simultaneous increase (a) in the number, the budgets and the staffing of regulatory agencies, as well as the number of regulations, and (b) of economic liberalization, as measured by economic freedom and doing business indices. This is the ""freer markets, more rules"" or ""more capitalism, more regulations"" puzzle. This puzzle provides a window into the underlining mechanisms behind the complex regulatory developments in advanced democracies and transition economies, showcasing both some convergence trends and some diversity of the regulatory national patterns. Before the recent post-financial crisis backlash, the neoliberal agenda of privatization and deregulation seems to have happened in a roundabout manner as a side-effect of regulatory capitalism, rather than by implementing the policy and institutional recommendations of authors like Hayek, Friedman, and Buchanan. Three common hypotheses about ""neoliberalism"" don't work very well: pro-market ideology as a driver of policy, rent-seeking in favor of deregulation, and markets outpacing attempts at government regulation. Two other hypotheses provide better insight: a heterogeneous regulatory environment allows private firms to engage in regulatory arbitrage, and political entrepreneurs under public finance constraints look for novel ways of obtaining tax revenues. The emerging picture provides a serious challenge to both critics and supporters of neoliberalism."
K23|Transparent Selection of Judges for EU Courts: Complaint to the European Ombudsman|This complaint to the European Ombudsman by Access Info Europe and the HEC-NYU EU Public Interest Clinic alleges maladministration in the selection of judges for the Courts of Justice of the EU (CJEU). The complaint argues that the Council of Europe wrongly refused access to information on selection processes used for CJEU judges. For each judicial appointment to the CJEU, a special panel issues an opinion regarding the candidate’s suitability. This opinion is not made publicly available and is only shared with member states. Since 2014, the clinic has repeatedly sought access to the panel opinions. The underlying rationale for requesting access to these opinions is that the public has a right to expect a high degree of transparency about the professional competence of candidates during the judicial selection process. The Council denied access to the opinions arguing Regulation 1049/2001 (on public access to EU institutions’ documents) does not apply to the requested documents and that the procedure for appointing judges and Advocates General is not within the Council’s “sphere of responsibility.” The EU Ombudsman opened an investigation in 2015 and after examining the panel’s opinion she encouraged the Council to reconsider its disclosure policy. During this process, the Council announced that it had reassessed its practices and decided to apply Regulation 1049/2001 to documents held by its General Secretariat in relation to tasks supporting various intergovernmental bodies and entities, including the relevant panel. The Ombudsman welcomed the Council's policy change, and encouraged the complainants to file a new access request to the Council. In her final 2016 decision, the Ombudsman stated that data relating to the professional competence and activities of public figures, especially those appointed to a high level public posts, may not require the same level of protection as might apply to personal data in other circumstances. Access Info and the clinic therefore made a repeat request to the Council. A first reply from the Council, received on the same day as the Ombudsman published her final 2016 decision, only granted partial access to the documents and left aside all information relating to the suitability of the candidates – which is the subject matter of this complaint.
K23|Regulation of Charlatans in High-Skill Professions|We model a market for a skill that is in short supply and high demand, where the presence of charlatans (professionals who sell a service that they do not deliver on) is an equilibrium outcome. We use this model to evaluate the standards and disclosure requirements that exist in these markets. We show that reducing the number of charlatans through regulation decreases consumer surplus. Although both standards and disclosure drive charlatans out of the market, consumers are worse off because of the resulting reduction in competition amongst producers. Producers, on the other hand, strictly benefit from the regulation, implying that the regulation we observe in these markets likely derives from producer interests. Using these insights, we study the factors that drive the cross-sectional variation in charlatans across professions. Professions with weak trade groups, skills in larger supply, shorter training periods and less informative signals regarding the professional's skill, are more likely to feature charlatans.
K23|Damage caps and defensive medicine, revisited|Does tort reform reduce defensive medicine and thus healthcare spending? Several (though not all) prior studies, using a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach, find lower Medicare spending for hospital care after states adopt caps on non-economic or total damages (“damage caps”), during the “second” reform wave of the mid-1980s. We re-examine this issue in several ways. We study the nine states that adopted caps during the “third reform wave,” from 2002 to 2005. We find that damage caps have no significant impact on Medicare Part A spending, but predict roughly 4% higher Medicare Part B spending. We then revisit the 1980s caps, and find no evidence of a post-adoption drop (or rise) in spending for these caps.
K23|L’économie des plateformes : dissipation ou concentration de la rente?|The platforms-based economy seems to be the opposite of the rent-based one. On its non-profit acceptation, a platform may participate to the sharing economy, favouring non-market transactions in order to mutualise assets or to share services. On its for-profit acceptation, it provides more efficient matching services and helps to bypass regulations, sometimes harmful in terms of prices and of quality of services. However, a platform might be less a tool of rent dispersion than a vector of its polarisation. High dominance levels based on data and algorithms may allow platforms to implement perfect price discrimination strategies. If these ones may be welfare-enhancing, they involve surplus transfers between economic agents. We discuss the contestability level of these dominant operators by taking into account the counter-strategies of market participants, the extended rivalry hypothesis and the disruptive potential of blockchain.
K23|Un modèle d'accident unilatéral: incertitude non-radicale et estimations différenciées|Cet article reconsidère le modèle d'accident unilatéral standard en univers probabiliste (hors incertitude radicale). Contrairement à ce dernier, les agents (porteur de préjudice et victime) forment des estimations différentes sur la distribution de probabilité d’accident et l'évaluation des dommages. En conséquence, le coût social d'un accident varie suivant le type de responsabilité civile (invariable dans le modèle standard). La correspondance entre les régimes de la responsabilité sans faute et la règle de la négligence n'existe plus sauf dans l’hypothèse où le pollueur estime les coûts des dommages à un niveau supérieur à celui de la victime.
K23|Settling Inconsistencies Associated with The Genesis of The Financial Services Authority Act|"""Objective – The FSA Act the establishment of which is mandated by Article 34 of Law No. 23 of 1999 concerning the Bank of Indonesia, was enacted on 22 November 2011. This Act, together with Law No. 3 of 2004, regulates and supervises Indonesia’s integrated financial services sector. This article reveals the existence of inconsistencies between the legal terms underlying the establishment of the FSA one the one hand, and the provisions contained in the Financial Service Authority itself, on the other. These inconsistencies also become evident in the light of the 1945 Constitution which facilitated the establishment of the Bank of Indonesia Law. The purpose of this article is to ascertain a method of resolving these inconsistencies associated with the genesis of the Financial Service Authority. Methodology/Technique – The research method used in this article is doctrinal in nature that uses secondary data and information sources as material to analyse the relevant problems. Findings – The research has revealed that the most appropriate method of settling these inconsistencies requires a consideration of the express wording of the FSA. Novelty – This article indicates the need to apply legal principles rather and adjudicatory methods."""

Methodology/Technique – The study reviews literature in related area. Findings – Findings indicate that the merger and acquisition (M&A) which have taken place recently by other foreign insurers with our local Takaful operators show that the growth of this industry is promising for years to come for the foreign insurers to tap into our Takaful market. Novelty – The study attempts to provides insight on effect of foreign companys’ merger and acquisition strategies in Takaful market."""
K23|Law Enforcement with a Democratic Government|In this article, we analyze how political competition affects the design of public law enforcement policies. The article arrives at two main conclusions (assuming that the cost of enforcement is linear, criminal’s type is uniformly distributed, and the society is wealthy enough): (1) electoral competition entails no loss of efficiency at equilibrium for both minor and major offenses (e.g., minor offenses are not enforced, while major ones are fully deterred); (2) distortions arises at equilibrium only in the range of intermediate offenses: enforcement expenditure for small offenses is lower than at optimal level, such that the issue of under-deterrence is exacerbated; in contrast, for more serious offenses, enforcement measures are higher, and there is more (possibly, over) deterrence as compared to what efficiency requires. We show that these results also generalize under more general assumptions, except that full deterrence of major offenses is no longer achievable (a less wealthy society), or enforcement expenditure is bounded above (under convex enforcement costs).
K23|Equity justifications for universal service obligations|Equity is often invoked as a possible justification for the imposition of universal service obligations (USOs). However, no previous analysis supports a formal link between equity and USO. In this paper, we describe the extent to which the imposition of USOs in oligopolistic network industries can meet the objectives of an inequality-averse regulator. We show that USOs can be used for equity purposes provided that the regulator is able to control the competitive structure of the industry. We also show that the uniform pricing constraint, which is an obligation to offer the same price conditions to all consumers, is welfare-enhancing but rather surprisingly, it does not necessarily improve equity.

K23|Banking Crises and the Japanese Legal Framework|This paper presents an overview of the Japanese system to deal with the distress of banks, providing a classification of the regulation and remedies based on the level of systemic risk of the troubled entity. The paper differentiates between the types of actions available and analyses in detail the instruments and their application. While the regulation is disperse and its apprehension is complicated for a foreign reader, Japan counts on a modern, thorough and adequate group of institutions and instruments to tackle bank distress. Its most notable feature is the proportionality of measures and the flexibility enjoyed by a resolution authority that may accommodate its intervention to the characteristics of the case and the degree of contagion risk. Although mainly inspired by the American model, the system is compared with the new European framework and FSB recommendations are considered. Although a few elements could be reconsidered, its high institutional level and flexibility make the Japanese system one capable of dealing with financial crises at both national and international levels.
K23|Crime and the legalization of recreational marijuana|First-pass evidence is provided that the legalization of the cannabis market across US states is inducing a crime drop. We exploit the staggered legalization of recreational marijuana enacted by the adjacent states of Washington (end of 2012) and Oregon (end of 2014). Combining county-level difference-in-differences and spatial regression discontinuity designs, we find that the policy caused a significant reduction in rapes and property crimes on the Washington side of the border in 2013–2014 relative to the Oregon side and relative to the pre-legalization years 2010–2012. The legalization also increased consumption of marijuana and reduced consumption of other drugs and both ordinary and binge alcohol. Four possible mechanisms are discussed: the direct psychotropic effects of cannabis; substitution away from violence-inducing substances; reallocation of police effort; reduced role of criminals in the marijuana business.
K23|The relationship between corporate governance characteristics and credit risk exposure in banks: implications for financial regulation|Abstract This article analyses board structures in listed Danish banks in the years prior to the financial crisis by exploring the relationship between corporate governance characteristics and credit risk exposure. The article presents a novel approach as it relies on a newly developed risk metric entitled the “Supervision Diamond” introduced by the Danish FSA, which “external” board directors must address. It contains five thresholds for measuring a bank’s exposure to credit risks i.e. the proportion of large customers, lending growth, the ratio of lending/deposits, liquidity buffer and the proportion of real estate loans. By employing quantitative governance variables the article finds that increased executive director remuneration is associated with increased credit risk posed by the bank’s borrowers. On the other hand, increasing the number of executive/“inside” directors is associated with a lower credit risk exposure. It is argued that more “inside” directors on the executive board constitutes a stronger “checks and balance” system. The article also documents that the probability of obtaining state capital from the Danish credit bailout package is negatively related to larger boards as well as higher executive director remuneration. The policy implication is that financial authorities should be increasingly aware of insufficient corporate governance characteristics in order to prevent excessive credit risk exposure. Moreover, the article provides important insights on which corporate governance variables have a significant impact on a bank’s credit risk exposure. This knowledge is valuable for financial authorities/policy makers considering future regulatory initiatives and how they should administer bank monitoring.
K23|Patent Quality and Examination in Europe|This paper reports on effects of recent administrative reforms at the European Patent Office (EPO). In EPO-granted patents, claims numbers started to decline in 2008 when new claims fees became effective, claims sections in patents became shorter, and independent claims longer and presumably more specific. The grant rate remained at relatively low levels, but the EPO was unable to stem the use of divisional filings. The developments at the EPO point to a high private value of delay options. Delay may be achieved either by making use of explicit statutory rules or by other means, such as filing divisional applications.
K23|Retail Alcohol Availability and Product Diversity| The repeal of the Prohibition Act in 1933 introduced many state-specific regulations in alcohol markets. As one example of this, several states currently have laws that restrict specific alcoholic beverages in grocery stores, and some states have recently considered lifting these restrictions. Some opponents of such legislative changes claim that allowing alcohol to be more widely distributed would put smaller liquor stores out of business and eventually lead to a narrower set of product choices available to consumers. Here we use the Nielsen Homescan dataset that describes alcoholic beverage purchasing patterns for approximately 70,000 households between 2004 and 2012 to examine this issue empirically. Our results show that, even when controlling for preferences for variety, consumers in states that allow beer and wine sales in grocery stores have greater diversity in their purchases of beer and wine. Overall, the findings suggest that expanding the retail availability of beer and wine may actually increase the diversity of alcoholic beverage products purchased by consumers in those states.
K23|Informal Institutions in the Corporate Governance System in Russia|The corporate governance system in Russia, having evolved through years, can be characterized by the following features: the dominant role of the concentrated ownership structure, corporate supervision relying on a combination of ownership function and company management, the significant role of the state as the owner, and the fairly marginal relevance of external market mechanisms. Those features result partly from particular legal solutions and partly from the unwritten, informal customs or patterns of behaviour of the so-called informal institutions. The article’s main thrust is to analyse selected informal institutions which were considered the most significant from the Russian corporate governance system point of view. These are, among others: the tendency not to obey the rights of minority shareholders, informal relationships of enterprises with authorities of various levels, and corruption. The author assumes that informal institutions decide upon the specificity of the corporate governance system in Russia and its particular elements, and upon the efficient functioning of supervisory mechanisms.
K23|Informal Institutions in the Corporate Governance System in Russia|Various scholars of ethics and economics conduct research on the best modes of decision making which guarantee good outcome and moral behaviour of the individuals involved. Either of the modes considered, rules with regulations or discretion and judgment, find applicability in diversified professional circumstances. The paper investigates how discretion can be used in professional activity by using the Aristotelic-Thomistic framework. Results indicate that such a framework can be used by engineers in their working environments and by other working professionals with the main proposition that only in discretionary decision making is the person able to take full responsibility for the outcomes and to premeditate their moral worth in conscience before resolving to commit the act itself.
K23|The consequences of not applying mutátis mutándis a decision of the Romanian Constitutional Court|"The article aims at procedural mechanism of application of art.147, paragraph 2 of Romanian Constitution, in the specific case of pronouncing an unconstitutionality decision which concerns a law in draft before its promulgation, but especially focuses on the effects produced by such a normative act adopted without consideration of the Constitutional Court Decision. In other words, the Parliament, although bound to reconsider those provisions to bring them into line with the Constitutional Court decision, for failure to comply with this obligation, it brings us into the situation of prevalence inability of this Constitutional Court Decision and breach of a law in force which was, moreover, declared unconstitutional still at the planning stage. In this way, we find that the effects in question are reflected in an unfavorable way; above all the interest of local collectivities; and raises a big question mark on the achievement of both the ""joint"" powers of Parliament's own, and the concept of ""local autonomy"" by those who exercise it, knowing your rights, obligations and limits allowed."
K23|Premises for the establishing of the European Administrative Space|Article analyzes the premises which made possible the creation of a European Administrative Space in the European Union. Are researched the criteria for belonging to the European Space, the conditions for the existence of a European Public Space and the notion of the European Administrative Space. They emphasize the factors that can determine a unified transnational public law by analyzing the administrative convergences in Europe. Today we find that although the term and concept of law of public administration differ from one national system to another, it is possible an agreement on a common definition of administrative law, as a set of principles and rules that relate to the organization and administration management public and relations between governments and citizens.
K23|FIDIC contracts: analysis of the impact of general and particular conditions on the financial risk management in Romanian infrastructure projects|Construction projects are characterized by risks and uncertainties mainly due to technical and economic complexity. Risk management is an important tool in making decisions involving the identification and reduction, avoidance or transfer risk and uncertainties consequences of events that occurs during project implementation. For this reason, the objective of the contract between the beneficiary and the contractor is the allocation of risk. The distribution of risk in contracts for the execution of construction works was and is an ongoing challenge faced by parties having a significant impact on the type of contract is used. On the one hand, the beneficiaries tend to transfer to the contractors as many of the project risks and uncertainties, on the other hand, the contractors look to exploit any weakness contract, so as to reduce their impact on the expected profit. One of the most important risks assumed by the contractor by signing the contract which is also increasingly common in the current economic situation is the reduced financial capacity to support the project. A purely legal or purely technical interpretation is not meant to describe the complexity of issues related to implementation of construction projects. For this reason the authors have adopted a multi-disciplinary approach, which includes the legal issues related to the nature of the contract, but also the financial and technical aspects of construction projects. The paper aims to analyze how special contract clauses can influence the implementation of construction projects and in particular the financial management of contractors. The authors propose a model for analyzing the impact of FIDIC contract conditions applied on a case study of five transport infrastructure projects.

K23|Some considerations on the legal qualification of the contracting authority|The present study makes an analysis of the concept of contracting authority in the context in which the legal definition of this concept leads, in several specific cases, to doubts and the impossibility of correct application of the law when one puts into discussion the local authorities and some legal persons of public law who have a well-defined legal status. Both situations create real difficulties in practice by the correct application of public procurement law so that it may challenge these parts of such public contracts even if they are of good faith and desire the fair enforcement of law.
K23|Considerations on the public services in the XXI century|The article analyzes from a comparative law perspective the notion of public service, underlining that outlines the administrative framework applicable legal regime. Public administration currently is defined both by its attribute of organization and execution of the law by setting specific binding behavior and by its attribute to meet social requirements through the provision of services under administrative law. The article analyzes the characteristics and principles underlying public service organization in the XXI century and modern public service categories, underscoring the blurring of the classical distinction now between administrative public services, and industrial and commercial services.
K23|The issue of the liquidation process of social enterprises during privatization process in Kosovo|"The privatization process in Kosovo with all its difficulties, permanent dilemmas entered into the final phase. Despite a considerable number of SOEs privatized until now there has not been any study done by any governmental or non-governmental body that will reflect more comprehensively the performance and its effects in economy. This process until now had several complex problems, changes and political, social, legal interests. In retrospective the privatization process in Kosovo evaluated by academics and media is considered to be one of the most specific and complicated phenomenon for the transformation of social assets in individuals or private enterprises. Its complexity has derived from what is meant by ""social ownership"" and who has been in fact its official in the past and which the rights are given to working class in possess management and governance. On these bases the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) founded by UNMIK in 2002 and later the Privatization Agency of Kosovo (PAK) founded in 2008 by the institutions of Kosovo after the declaration of independence (2007) have continued with the privatization 15 years later after the dilemmas and institutional transformation and we can say that economy in Kosovo is in collapse. PAK with all its successes admits that the difficulties of this process never stop. At the moment PAK is not recognized by the Special Chamber of Supreme Court of Kosovo and also there are problems and gaps in the law on the liquidation of social enterprises assets. The legal basis of OVGJS and the execution of the law for the reorganization of specific enterprises and their assets by shortening and simplifying the deadlines because they are causing serious bottlenecks and unwanted delays of proceedings."
K23|Internal controls in the Public Administration: current problems and future challenges|At the beginning of the 1990s, in line with trends in other European countries, the need to increase the efficiency of administrative activity resulted in legislative initiatives to extend some of the management tools developed in the private sector to the Public Administration. Among these instruments, an important role was assigned to internal controls. Over twenty years since their introduction, the functioning of public internal controls still displays several critical aspects. Through a comparative assessment with other European models, this paper highlights the problems affecting the legal framework of Italian public internal controls, such as the lack of a clearly identified internal audit structure; the paper also points out that controls focus almost exclusively on formal rather than substantive aspects. Moreover, the results of past performance appraisal activities show that the principles of ï¿½accountabilityï¿½ and ï¿½transparencyï¿½ are not widely applied within the Public Administration, thus undermining the effectiveness and usefulness of internal controls.

K23|Improving U.S. Transmission Expansion Policy Through Order No. 1000|" type=""main"" xml:id=""coep12158-abs-0001""> This article examines the latest attempt of the United States' regulatory agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), to promote transmission expansion through the transmission planning and cost allocation principles contained in its recently issued Order No. 1000. It finds the level of detail contained in the order's cost allocation principles to be insufficient to achieve FERC's goals. It argues that the order does provide important principles for both transmission planning and expansion, though. It thus presents a cost allocation methodology which channels the order's strengths. Specifically, the methodology obtains an estimate of the benefits of a project and aligns the costs and benefits of the project accordingly. (JEL K23, Q48)"
K23|Got to be certain: The legal framework for CCP default management processes|Central clearing offers numerous benefits to financial stability including multilateral netting of cleared exposures and the centralisation of default management. These benefits explain the pivotal role of central counterparties (‘CCPs’) in the post-crisis derivatives market reforms. However they lead to a key financial stability question: will CCPs be able to manage a large member default effectively?
K23|Recreational cannabis reduces rapes and thefts: Evidence from a quasi-experiment|An argument against the legalization of the cannabis market is that such a policy would increase crime. Exploiting the recent staggered legalization enacted by the states of Washington (end of 2012) and Oregon (end of 2014) we show, combining difference-in-differences and spatial regression discontinuity designs, that recreational cannabis caused a significant reduction of rapes and thefts on the Washington side of the border in 2013-2014 relative to the Oregon side and relative to the pre-legalization years 2010-2012.
K23|Competitive Pressure and Corporate Crime|This paper explores the relationship between the intensity of product market competition and firms’ incentives to resort to illegal means to lower their production costs. To this end, our framework combines a crime model à la Becker with a Salop circle. When law enforcement includes a fixed fine for illegal conduct, more intense competition due to a higher number of firms in the industry reduces the prevalence of crime, whereas more intense competition due to better substitutability between products may increase or decrease crime. In contrast, when the fine for corporate crime is proportional to profits, more intense competition unambiguously increases the prevalence of crime. In addition, we discuss the implications of the link between product market competition and corporate crime decisions for market entry and optimal law enforcement and elaborate on the relationship between law enforcement and a firm’s ability to commit to refraining from the use of illegal practices.

K23|Returns to ICT Skills|How important is mastering information and communications technology (ICT) in modern labor markets? Previous research offers no guidance in assessing the labor-market returns to ICT skills, primarily because skill data have been unavailable. We draw on unique data that provide internationally comparable information on ICT skills in 19 countries. Using an instrument that leverages cross-country variation in the technologically determined probability of having Internet access, we find that ICT skills are substantially rewarded in the labor market. Placebo estimations show that exogenous Internet availability cannot explain numeracy or literacy skills, suggesting that our identifying variation is independent of a person s general ability.
K23|Why Entrepreneurs Choose Risky R&D Projects – But Still Not Risky Enough|This article examines how entrepreneurs and incumbents differ in their R&D strategies. We show that entrepreneurs have incentives to choose projects with a higher risk and a higher potential in order to reduce expected entry costs. If products are not too differentiated, entrepreneurs will select projects that are too safe from a social point of view, since they do not internalise the business stealing effect on incumbents. Entry support induces entrepreneurs to choose safer projects, whereas R&D support encourages entrepreneurship without affecting the type of entrepreneurship.
K23|Local Loop Unbundling in the UK Does Not Affect Broadband Penetration - but It Does Lead to Better Service|Under an open access policy, incumbent broadband providers in all EU countries are required to let new market entrants access their networks through bitstream or local loop unbundling (LLU). This type of regulatory provision aims to increase competition among all broadband providers, and is strongly recommended in markets where the prohibitively high cost of setting up a distribution network means that market power is concentrated in the hands of a few players - or even one single player (such as in the case of telecommunications). This analysis uses data from the UK to investigate whether such a policy stimulates market entry and broadband penetration and/or leads to an increase in broadband quality. In contrast to what is commonly believed LLU does not increase internet penetration significantly or sustainably. It does, however, stimulate market entry as well as investments that substantially increase service quality. Thus this open access policy does not contribute to a digital divide in access. Although these results are based solely on experiences in the UK, they do point to the general advantages of infrastructure-based competition (based on LLU) over service-based competition (based on bitstream).

K23|Open Access im Breitbandmarkt hat keine Auswirkung auf die Verbreitung, fördert jedoch die Internetqualität: das Beispiel Großbritannien|Under an open access policy, incumbent broadband providers in all EU countries are required to let new market entrants access their networks through bitstream or local loop unbundling (LLU). This type of regulatory provision aims to increase competition among all broadband providers, and is strongly recommended in markets where the prohibitively high cost of setting up a distribution network means that market power is concentrated in the hands of a few players - or even one single player (such as in the case of telecommunications).

In contrast to what is commonly believed LLU does not increase internet penetration significantly or sustainably. It does, however, stimulate market entry as well as investments that substantially increase service quality. Thus while this open access policy does not contribute to a digital divide in access, it does clearly contribute to a divide in broadband quality.

In allen EU-Ländern sind die ehemals monopolistischen Breitbandanbieter im Rahmen einer Open-Access-Politik verpflichtet, neuen Anbietern über sogenannten Bitstrom oder die Entbündelung der TeilnehmerInnenanschlussleitung (Local Loop Unbundling, LLU) Zugang zu ihren Netzen zu gewähren. Diese Art der Regulierung soll für mehr Wettbewerb zwischen den Breitbandanbietern sorgen und wird besonders in Märkten wie der Telekommunikationsbranche empfohlen, in denen die hohen Kosten für die Errichtung eines Verteilnetzes die Konzentration der Marktmacht in den Händen weniger, wenn nicht sogar nur eines Marktteilnehmers begünstigen. Die vorliegende Analyse untersucht anhand von Daten aus Großbritannien, ob eine solche Politik stimulierend auf den Markteintritt, die Breitbandverbreitung und die Breitbandqualität wirkt. Anders als allgemein angenommen wird die Internetverbreitung durch Local Loop Unbundling nicht signifikant und nachhaltig erhöht. LLU fördert jedoch den Markteintritt und Investitionen, die die Qualität der Dienste erheblich verbessern. Somit trägt die Entbündelung der Anschlussleitungen nicht zu einer digitalen Kluft beim Internetzugang bei. Auch wenn die Ergebnisse auf den Erfahrungen in Großbritannien basieren, weisen sie auf den allgemeinen Vorteil hin, den ein infrastrukturbasierter Wettbewerb (LLU) im Vergleich zu einem dienstbasierten Wettbewerb (auf Grundlage von Bitstrom) haben kann.

K23|Inclusion of Consumption into Emissions Trading Systems: Legal Design and Practical Administration|A world of unequal carbon prices requires measures aimed at preventing carbon leakage. Climate policy imperatives demand that such measures must be compatible with the goal of sending a carbon price signal down the value chain. For carbon intensive materials, the combination of dynamic free allocation combined with Inclusion of Consumption (IoC) into emissions trading systems such as the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) arguably fulfils both the aims of preventing carbon leakage and of sending the price signal. The paper presents concrete proposals regarding the legal design and practical administration of this mechanism. It argues that the IoC is, provided appropriate choices are made, ripe for implementation.
K23|Market Break or Simply Fake? Empirics on the Causal Effects of Rent Controls in Germany|Rising rents in German cities have led to an intense debate about the need for tighter rent controls in housing markets. In April 2015, the so-called rental brake was introduced, which imposes upper bounds for rents in new contracts, in order to immediately slow down the increase of rents in tight housing markets. Since then, 11 federal states made use of this instrument. We take advantage of this intra-country variation and test whether the regulation had a causal effect on rents and house prices in the short run. We apply a standard difference-in-differences setup that allows us to study the effects of the rental brake on the underlying price trend in neighboring treated and non-treated postal-code districts. We ground our analysis on a large sample of online advertised rental dwellings and find that, contrary to the expectations of the policy makers, the rental brake has, at best, no impact in the short run. At worst, it even accelerates rent increases both in municipalities subject to the rental brake and in neighboring areas. We further conclude, based on our estimates on the development of dwelling prices, that investors expect on little impact on future rental income.
K23|The Strange Career Of Independent Voting Trusts In U.S. Rail Mergers|Voting trust arrangements have a long history at both the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and the Surface Transportation Board (STB) as devices to protect the incentives of acquiring firms and maintain the independence of acquiring and target firms during the pendency of regulatory investigation of the merger proposal. However, they are not without problems. The STB argued in 2001 that as Class I railroads have become fewer and larger, it may be difficult to find alternative purchasers for the firm whose shares are in the trust if the STB turns down the proposal. The Antitrust Division argued in 2016 that joint stock ownership creates anticompetitive and/or otherwise undesirable incentives, even if the independence of the voting trustee is complete. On the other hand, the functions served by voting trusts in railroad mergers are served by simple lockup agreements in other parts of the economy, without the same incentive problems as voting trusts. Thus voting trusts may no longer serve a useful function in railroad merger deliberations.
K23|Balancing Free Movement and Public Health: The Case of Minimum Unit Pricing of Alcohol in Scotch Whisky|Scotland is the first jurisdiction in the world to introduce a minimum price per unit of alcohol to reduce consumption. The relevant industry did not hesitate to challenge this new alcohol control policy before courts. The ensuing judgment contains a wealth of insights stemming from regulatory autonomy to proportionality review. What is the role of a national court in the review of national measures restricting free movement? In particular, how should it review the proportionality of those measures when adopted on public health grounds, and on the basis of what evidence? What is the burden of proof that the relevant Member State must discharge? Those are essentially the questions referred by a Scottish court to the Court of Justice when called upon to determine the compatibility with EU law of Minimum Unit Prices for alcohol introduced by the Scottish Government. Although rather recurrent in the Court’s free movement case law, the question of the standard of review, and corresponding burden of proof epitomises the struggle currently faced by national courts in striking the right balance between the proper functioning of the market and due recognition and protection of national regulatory autonomy. As such, this preliminary reference offered an opportunity to address “the information gap on what the Court of Justice expects defendant States to establish” in order to justify their measures under the proportionality stages of free movement analysis. But there is more. This case also raises deeper epistemic and methodological questions faced by any court of law when asked to review the proportionality, and in particular the necessity, of an individual policy intervention that belongs to a wider ‘political strategy’. Indeed, those strategies – as exemplified in the present case by the Scottish policy designed to combat the devastating effects of alcohol – generally entail the enactment of a full ‘regulatory mix’ of policy interventions. In those circumstances, how can we pinpoint the effect of a given policy option when it is part of a set of measures? How can we distinguish the effect, in terms of health gains deriving from a drop in alcohol consumption, to be ascribed to the introduction of MUP when such a measure coexists with other measures (more than 40 in Scotland) that have been introduced? And what when the contested measure has never been tested before? While this judgment confirms the gradual empirical turn made by the Court in its own review of the proportionality of national restrictive measures, it also provides some pragmatic guidance on how national courts may realistically engage in that review. Given the growing number of Member States ready to experiment with new policies aimed at tackling inter alia lifestyle risk factors, such as tobacco use, harmful consumption of alcohol and unhealthy diets, this appears as welcome development. Ultimately, the ensuing number of national restrictive measures of trade enacted on public health grounds, such as the UK standardised packaging for cigarettes, its sugar tax or the Hungarian ‘fat tax’, is set to put to test the Court’s approach towards both the qualification of those measures as restrictions and their justification under EU law.
K23|Reconstructing Renewable Energy: Making Wind and Solar Power Dispatchable, Reliable and Efficient|This paper is important because it explains how to create a grid-scale energy storage system (ESS) that makes, for the first time, wind and solar renewable energy—dispatchable, reliable and efficient. Existing and recent discoveries in battery technology are analyzed, with the most appropriate recommended for use in the new ESS. Additionally, an innovative time-shifting ESS design approach is presented that decouples electricity production from use, considerably improving total wind and solar power peak average capacity contribution values. This minimizes the need for expensive standby natural-gas combustion turbine peaker plants—thereby decreasing costs by 75%. Furthermore, this advanced ESS improves performance by making the interconnection grid more reliable and better able to handle changing customer demands, relieves transmission congestion, and decreases unscheduled power outages—and also provides ancillary services; thereby improving system-wide benefits by 30-to-40%, further reducing effective ESS costs, perhaps to zero.
K23|Analysis of Income Elasticities of Brazil’s Energy Matrix|This study aims to estimate and analyze the income elasticities of Brazil’s energy matrix, represented by the supply and consumption of energy. We sought to compare the income elasticities of both energy products and consumption through secondary sources and consumer sectors. This is an explanatory or relational research of an ex-post-facto nature, analyzing the period from 1970 to 2011, using the ANCOVA-EC estimation method. The results obtained from the estimates show that both for energy products, as in relation to industrial sectors, the elasticities are statistically different. The naphta, natural gas and ethyl alcohol had the highest elasticities in the energy matrix, and the industries ferro-alloy, non-ferrous metals and nonenergy are the most sensitive to income growth. When elasticities are compared with the sectoral energy intensity index, there is evidence that less efficient sectors have higher income elasticities. In summary the results show that there is sectors or products that are more sensitive to economic growth where the energy-intensive and demand presented as the main factors to explain the sensitivity, there is also evidence to demonstrate that the level of efficiency is different compared the different sectors.
K23|Decision-making during the credit crisis: Did the Treasury let commercial banks fail?|Limited attention has been paid to the comparative fate of banks benefiting from Capital Purchase Program (CPP) funding and less fortunate banks subject to FDIC resolution. We address this omission by investigating two core issues. One is whether commercial banks that ended up being subject to FDIC resolution received CPP funds. The other is whether the non-allocation of CPP funds made FDIC receivership more likely for viable commercial banks. Our findings show almost no overlap between CPP-funded and FDIC-resolved commercial banks, but we provide evidence that a significant number of FDIC-resolved banks could have avoided receivership if they had been allocated CPP funding. By comparing estimated funding and resolution costs we also show that bailing out more banks would have been cost-efficient. While our results do not allow for any policy suggestion on the optimality of bailouts per se, they suggest that once a bailout program is already on the table, it is better to err on the side of rescuing too many rather than too few banks.
K23|Motivations for market restructuring: Evidence from U.S. electricity deregulation|The purpose of this paper is to examine whether electricity restructuring was brought about due to the Public Interest Theory (that regulatory changes are undertaken to benefit society) or the Interest Group Theory (that groups hoping to gain from deregulation lobby for regulatory changes). From 1996 to 2002 eighteen states developed restructuring programs targeted at improving efficiency through the use of increased wholesale trading, abolition of ‘cost of service’ regulation, measures to open electricity production to non-utility entities, and the unbundling of transmission and distribution. Results indicate some evidence of the Public Interest Theory and strong evidence of the Interest Group Theory.
K23|The impact of alternative governance forms of regional public rail transport on transaction costs. Case evidence from Germany and Switzerland|This article addresses transaction costs of different governance forms in regional public rail transport by comparing Germany's competitive contract awarding model with Switzerland's direct contract awarding model. We propose a concept of transaction costs with four dimensions, namely the awarding procedure, the institutional framework, provision of system services, and the impact of learning and innovation. We then identify drivers and amounts of transaction costs in both governance forms. In Germany's competitive model, public transport authorities (PTAs) must guarantee effective competition using different instruments, whereas transaction costs are lowered by clear definition and allocation of responsibilities. In Switzerland's cooperative model, costly competition surrogates serve to overcome information asymmetries. An informal and trusting culture of cooperation prevents high transaction costs. Factors such as complexity of different kinds or unforeseen behaviour of PTAs increase transaction costs in any model. Summing up, our results illustrate that transaction costs are no legitimate argument against competition if the high amounts of subsidies are taken into account. Introducing competition for the market in Switzerland's regional public rail transport, however, would be challenging and trigger high one-time reform costs since it would relate to a radical ‘cultural change’.
K23|Transaction and transition costs during the deregulation of the Swedish Railway market|The research on regulatory reform has identified and measured three types of costs associated with the shift from monopoly to competition: transaction costs, misalignment costs and transition costs. In this article we use a case study approach to measure and compare these costs during the deregulation of the Swedish railway system from 2000–2015. Our case studies confirm earlier research that vertical separation and the introduction of competition in the railway markets result in comparatively small direct transaction costs. Extraordinary transaction costs in the form of interrupted contracts are also a minor problem for the railway system as a whole but might create major problems for the affected region. Our research concurs with earlier research on the British railway system and a CER study that misalignment costs seem to be significantly bigger and more troublesome to handle than direct transaction costs. Railway maintenance costs in Sweden using competitive tenders are increasing four to five times faster than railway operations with no measurable improvement in performance. Transition costs have been and continue to be important in the deregulated Swedish railway system. First, procrastination in the form of delayed changes in the allocation of train paths results in misalignment costs that seem to be growing. Second, adjustment costs in the form of handouts to the former monopolist have been ten times higher than the costs for interrupted contracts.
K23|Towards a Requisite Regulatory Management System: Philippines|Part One of this paper explores the evolution of regulation in the Philippines since the post-martial rule regime. This paper tracks the macroeconomic and regulatory reforms, and the political and economic history. It explores the existence of a regulatory management system in the Philippines, identifying that the Philippines does not have a coherent regulatory management system, but does has some of the parts of such a system. Parts Two explores how some aspects of a regulatory management system were applied in the successful case study of regulatory change in the establishment of the National Competitiveness Council, a public private partnership, while Part Three looks at another successful case in the regulatory reforms of Quezon City’s Business Permit and Licensing System.
K23|Towards Responsive Regulatory Management Systems: Country Report for Viet Nam|This paper reviews the experiences of Viet Nam in improving its approach to regulatory management. Since 1986, Viet Nam promulgated and amended a number of laws and regulations to regulate economic activities in line with market-oriented reforms. A side effect of more laws and regulations has been the increasing compliance costs of the business community. Viet Nam then gradually introduced good regulatory practices, including regulatory impact assessment, online publication of draft, regulatory planning, etc. Numerous efforts were also sought to simplify and control administrative procedures, the most notable of which were under Project 30 since 2007 and Resolution 19 since 2014. Both Project 30 and Resolution 19 produced quick and material outcomes. Further meaningful reforms of administrative procedures depend on whether Viet Nam can build up sufficient confidence of stakeholders in the process. As the key lessons from Project 30 and Resolution 19, further improvement of regulatory management requires strong political will, involvement of relevant stakeholders, and enactment of separate bodies with a clear mandate and sufficient capacity.
K23|Constitutional Issues of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)|European history has always been characterized by a strong link between banks and States and, more generally, between banks and politics. National banking systems, therefore, have always been one of the forms of expression of sovereignty. This setting is seriously called into question by the Banking Union project, which has been recently implemented in Europe. Given the importance of the issue, this should be studied not only from the perspective of economics and regulatory studies, but also from the perspective of constitutional law. The paper, after a reconstruction of the historical and economic conditions that have led to design a project of Banking Union, analyzes several constitutional issues. In particular, te paper focuses on the friction points between the European Banking Union and the democratic principle, the rule of law and the justiciability principle.
K23|L’Unione bancaria e il suo impatto sul rapporto tra intermediari e consumatori|Nel diritto europeo, la vigilanza bancaria si sovrappone chiaramente a discipline giuridiche privatistiche, tanto più a seguito della progressiva realizzazione dell’Unione bancaria. Ciò si verifica anzitutto nella governance societaria della banca, ossia nella disciplina della sua auto-organizzazione, in particolare per quanto riguarda i poteri e le responsabilità dei singoli organi. Diritti e doveri di rilevanza privatistica derivano poi dalla disciplina del risanamento e della c.d. risoluzione delle banche, soprattutto per quanto riguarda il meccanismo del bail-in. Infine, si deve esaminare l’impatto della vigilanza bancaria sui diritti e gli obblighi contrattuali e pre-contrattuali tra le banche e i loro clienti. Un esempio paradigmatico di tale fenomeno si può rinvenire nella disciplina del credito ai consumatori. In particolare, gli standard di vigilanza inerenti alle pratiche di prestito responsabile (responsible lending) si traducono nell’obbligo della banca di prestare nella fase pre-contrattuale un vero e proprio servizio di consulenza finanziaria a favore del consumatore.
K23|Telecommunications Regulatory Design in Brazil: Networking around State Capacity Deficits|The relationship between regulatory agencies and business firm behavior has been a fertile soil for legal theories that aim to explain variations in regulatory success and failure. By stirring away from command-and-control models, legal theories of decentered regulatory approaches support the claim that the main incentives for regulated enterprises to comply with regulations come from the business folkways, whose virtues should be harvested by regulators to advance public policies. This article contends that applications of sociolegal scholarship supporting internal business coercion and the theory of responsive regulation can be found in recent regulatory frameworks used by the telecommunications independent agency of Brazil. In order to maintain that Brazilian regulation on telecommunications recently stirred away from a command-and-control approach, this article uncovers manifestations of the theory of responsive regulation in the telecommunications sector in relevant cases such as pay TV and broadcasting frequency reallocation at 4G auctions, number portability management, and wholesale deals supervision of operators with significant market power.

K23|The Negligence Rule Specificity under Radical Uncertainty|This article is an attempt to reassess the relationships between the strict liability regime and the negligence rule under radical uncertainty (ambiguity theory). In an accident model two representative agents (potential injurer and victim) form divergent beliefs about the probability distribution of an accident and the potential damage scale. It issues on the following results: 1) When the injurer's wealth cover the damage cost, then the socially first-best level of care is established by the injurer under strict liability only. When, the injurer's wealth is insufficient, this level is not reach (capped strict liability regime for instance). 2) Under negligence, the authorities (Regulator or Court) can choose as first best level of care either the level that favors the injurer's interests or the victim ones of. No rational rule can justify a choice rather than the other. 3) The efficiency of both regimes cannot be compared because they obey to different logics.
K23|Pharmaceutical Patents and Generic Entry Competition: A New View on the Hatch-Waxman Act|We present a formal analysis that sheds new light on the Hatch-Waxman Act. Hatch-Waxman restores incentives to develop new drugs by extending the patent life for them, but also promotes generic entry by reducing entry costs and by providing 180-day marketing exclusivity to a first challenger to the patent. Although these two objectives appear incompatible, our model shows that marketing exclusivity, with a significant entry cost reduction, contributes to incentive restoration. It finds however that social welfare is lower with marketing exclusivity. Finally, our analysis suggests that marketing exclusivity not be granted in the case of drugs for rare diseases.
K23|Reverse payments and generic entry competition|In the United States, brand-name drug manufacturers often pay generic companies to delay marketing of their generic products. In this paper we develop an analytical framework to examine the implications of banning reverse payment settlements. We first find that reverse payment settlements occur when generic firms face relatively high entry cost but do not when entry costs are sufficiently low. We next show cases in which reverse payment settlements are harmful to brands. We also consider the counterfactual case when 180-day marketing exclusivity rights are removed from Hatch-Waxman and find that the absence of marketing exclusivity rights encourages brands to proceed with reverse payment settlements.
K23|Ökonomische Wirkungen der Handwerksnovelle 2004: Ergebnisse aus einem quasinatürlichen Experiment|Die Reform der Handwerksordnung des Jahres 2004 brachte insbesondere durch die Abschaffung der Meisterpflicht für mehr als die Hälfte der Gewerbezweige des Handwerks eine umfassende Liberalisierung der Zugangsbedingungen. Der vorliegende Beitrag analysiert unter Verwendung von Daten des Zentralverbandes des Deutschen Handwerks (ZDH) den Einfluss der Handwerksnovelle auf die Anzahl der Betriebe und die Ausbildungsleistung in den betroffenen Handwerken. Die Wirkungen der Handwerksnovelle werden durch das Differenz-von-Differenzen-Verfahren geschätzt, das darauf aufbaut, dass nur ein Teil der Gewerbezweige des Handwerks von der Reform betroffen war. Die Ergebnisse zeigen einen starken Anstieg der Anzahl der Betriebe und einen Rückgang der absolvierten Meisterprüfungen in den betroffenen Handwerken in Folge der Reform. Bezüglich der Ausbildungsleistung werden jedoch keine statistisch signifikanten Effekte ermittelt. Umfangreiche Robustheitsanalysen bestätigen diese Ergebnisse.
K23|Key Person Insurance Essential In The Family Business, Seguro Del Hombre Clave Indispensable En La Empresa Familiar|This research is fiscal examination. The paper aims to demonstrate with scientific methods the deductibility of the expense for key man insurance. The problem is insecurity in the country, and the need in some family businesses to count and deduct as expenses key man insurance. This figure is considered a key part or main gear for the continuity of the family business. The phenomenon arises when this figure disappears unexpectedly, due to illness, temporary or permanent disability, even death. Of the 42 medium-sized Monclova, Coahuila, Mexico, businesses featuring figures with key man characteristics, we surveyed twenty for the sample. It resulted in lacking an insurance plan to compensate the taxpayer for the decrease in productivity the loss of a key man could cause. In the event that the key man disappears, the family company receives income from the insurance. This income is considered taxable.
K23|A Theory of How and Why Central-Bank Culture Supports Predatory Risk-Taking at Megabanks|Abstract This paper applies Schein’s model of organizational culture to financial firms and their prudential regulators. It identifies a series of hard-to-change cultural norms and assumptions that support go-for-broke risk-taking by megabanks that meets the everyday definition of theft. The problem is not to find new ways to constrain this behavior, but to change the norms that support it by establishing that managers of megabanks owe duties of loyalty, competence, and care directly to taxpayers.
K23|Innovative regulations, incomplete contracts and ownership structure in the water utilities|Abstract Using an incomplete contract framework, we analyse new forms of regulation and private participation in public services. This paper explains contractual efficiency in the absence of financially guaranteed investments in public private partnerships. The example of a number of African countries underlines how a series of national, normative law reforms can give rise to innovations in approaches to regulation. This new hybrid form of regulation, inspired by a French regulation approach combining commission regulation and franchise bidding, could be more effective than previous approaches to regulation, in the sense of being more stable and more closely aligned with stakeholder expectations. This approach to regulation would appear to be more efficient economically, while integrating the objectives of solidarity tariffs and social water access connections. Based on these analyses, our results show (1) the impact on the robustness of new lease contracts on financing constraints, and (2) the advantages of Asset Owner Companies that reconcile explicit commitments and special purposes. We demonstrate that this achieves optimum efficiency by encouraging parties to determine jointly the optimal level of costs and investment. In addition, the mechanism fosters discussion about the possibility of institutionalizing Asset Owner Companies by predetermining the distribution of risk in lease contracts.
K23|Regulating networks in decline|Abstract Demand for some services provided on traditional postal, electricity, gas and fixed telecommunications networks can be characterized as being in decline in some jurisdictions. Declining demand can give rise to difficult questions for regulators, in particular, the extent to which network operators can fully recover the costs of historic investments, and the efficiency and distributional effects of applying different rate structures. It can also raise fundamental questions about: the on-going rationale for regulation; the essential functions provided by network operators; and whether regulations should be applied symmetrically to traditional and alternative suppliers. Depending on the pace and scale of the decline, regulation may need to adapt. Proposals for adapting regulation are identified and critically examined in this paper, particularly in terms of the approach to setting the allowed level of revenues and the determination of rate structures.
K23|“Effective regulatory stringency” and firms’ profitability: the effects of effluent limits and government monitoring|Abstract The Porter hypothesis asserts that properly designed environmental regulation motivates firms to innovate, which ultimately improves profitability. Specifically, the Porter hypothesis posits that more stringent environmental regulation, i.e., greater regulatory stringency, leads to greater profitability. In contrast, the conventional “costly regulation” hypothesis posits that greater regulatory stringency weakens profitability mostly by driving up abatement costs. This study empirically tests these two hypotheses. Of course, regulatory stringency is difficult to measure. More important, regulatory stringency as codified in legislated acts and promulgated rules does not necessarily reflect regulatory stringency in practice, which we deem as “effective regulatory stringency”. Measurement of “effective regulatory stringency” is even more challenging. With this challenge in mind, we divide “effective regulatory stringency” into its two constituent components—(1) legal requirements and (2) regulatory scrutiny—the latter representing government efforts to ensure compliance with the legal requirements. For our analysis, we examine legal requirements in the form of facility-specific effluent limits and regulatory scrutiny in the form of government monitoring inspections. For our empirical analysis, we analyze the U.S. Clean Water Act under which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency imposes numeric wastewater discharge limits on permitted facilities and conducts wastewater-related inspections. As its primary contribution, our study separately examines the effects of legal requirements and regulatory scrutiny on firm-level profitability in order to appreciate the influence of “effective regulatory stringency”.
K23|Freight Rail Costing and Regulation: The Uniform Rail Costing System|Abstract Railroad regulation in the post-Staggers Act regime compares the revenues earned to a measure of the “variable cost” of the shipment. While revenues are readily observed, the “variable cost” is calculated using the “Uniform Rail Costing System” (URCS) that was developed by the Interstate Commerce Commission. We characterize the properties of the URCS rail costing methodology and its role in rate regulation, and we assess whether it produces an economically valid estimate of the cost caused by a rail shipment. We find that the URCS methodology is an accounting cost allocation procedure that does not recover an estimate of the cost of a rail shipment that a rational railroad operator would use to make pricing or operating decisions. We then explain why in the post-Staggers Act regime, even if an economic meaningful shipment cost measure were available, this information would not come any closer to solving the problem of determining what is an unreasonable price for a railroad to charge. We conclude by arguing that the use of the URCS methodology should be abandoned in railroad rate reasonableness regulation and replaced with a price benchmarking approach.
K23|The Regulatory Determinants of Railroad Safety|Abstract The dramatic improvement in railroad safety since the 1970s has been accompanied by a substantial increase in safety regulation and a substantial reduction in economic regulation after 1980. We assess the effects of both regulatory changes on railroad safety with the use of RegData: a new data set that was developed by one of the authors that measures the amount of regulation that is imposed by specific regulatory agencies on specific industries. We find that partial economic deregulation is associated with improved safety. Safety regulation was most closely associated with improved railroad safety during the period when economic regulation curtailed railroads’ incentives to operate safely.
K23|Das Bestellerprinzip — Entlastung für den Mieter oder Augenwischerei?<BR>[The Principle “Who Orders Pays”: Easing the Burden for Tenants or Just Window Dressing?]|Zusammenfassung Mit der Implementierung des Bestellerprinzips — wer den Makler beauftragt, mußs ihn auch bezahlen — hat der Gesetzgeber einen Wechsel der Zahllast für die Courtage vom Mieter zum Vermieter vorgenommen. Ob die intendierte Entlastung der Mieter gelingt, hängt maßgeblich vom Grad der Überwälzung auf die Miete ab. Auf der Verliererseite werden die Makler sein, da sie mit einer geringeren Nachfrage sowie einer Erosion der Courtage rechnen müssen.
K23|Bank resolution as a new MNB function – resolution of MKB BankAdministrative law aspects of the macroprudential regulation and supervision of the financial intermediary system – normativity, organisation, toolkit|Macroprudential policy has developed a new set of instruments for the mechanisms with which the state intervenes in the economy through its public administration. However, the global economic crisis and the need for rapid action did not allow time for the inclusion of macroprudential policy into the dogmatics of administrative law and therefore this needs to be done subsequently. This study analyses the legal nature of normative regulation related to macroprudential policy, the organisational features of the macroprudential authority and the legal appearance of macroprudential instruments. The final conclusion of the study is that the content of the public good or public goal, i.e. financial stability, to be implemented by macroprudential policy is extremely poorly defined. Considering the above, for the assessment of the achievement of financial stability, i.e. for the state control of the efficient fulfilment of the public goal, the regulatory environment must create an efficient legal guarantee system.
K23|Statehood Experience, Legal Traditions, And Climate Change Policies|This paper investigates how the implementation of modern climate change policies is related to former colonies' length of state history and their legal heritage. We argue that countries with longer statehood experience around the time of colonization were better equipped to implement the legal philosophies transplanted by their colonial powers. Therefore, the implications of receiving British common law versus French civil law should be particularly important in countries with a greater accumulated history of statehood. Using a cross section of up to 78 former colonies, our results provide support for this hypothesis. In particular, our estimates demonstrate that common law countries have weaker modern climate change policies than civil law countries and the difference is in ated by a longer statehood experience, measured by the length of state history from 1-1800 AD. Legal origin has no e ect in areas which, by the time of colonization, had no statehood experience.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K23|The diversity of agents and evolution of overlapping patents on electric vehicles|This article studies the inventive activity related to electric vehicles. Particularly, examining the relationship between the overlapping patents and a diverse population of agents: Companies, non-practicing entities, individual inventors and alliances. Based on information from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), period from 1976 to 2012, it is presented: 1) as from network analysis, the increasing complexity of inventive electric vehicles; 2) the characteristics and evolution of inventive activity and, 3) its relationship with the existence of overlapping patents. It is shown that the evolution of overlapping patents (from low to high complexity) is associated with greater complexity of technological knowledge as well as greater diversity of agents.
K23|On a World Climate Assembly and the Social Cost of Carbon|This paper postulates the conceptually useful allegory of a futuristic “World Climate Assembly” (WCA) that votes for a single worldwide price on carbon emissions via the basic democratic principle of one-person one-vote majority rule. If this WCA framework can be accepted in the first place, then voting on a single internationally- binding minimum carbon price (the proceeds from which are domestically retained) tends to counter self-interest by incentivizing countries or agents to internalize the externality. I attempt to sketch out the sense in which each WCA-agent's extra cost from a higher emissions price is counter-balanced by that agent's extra benefit from inducing all other WCA-agents to simultaneously lower their emissions in response to the higher price. The first proposition of this paper derives a relatively simple formula relating each emitter's single-peaked most-preferred world price of carbon emissions to the world “Social Cost of Carbon” (SCC). The second and third propositions relate the WCA-voted world price of carbon to the world SCC. I argue that the WCA-voted price and the SCC are unlikely to differ sharply. Some implications are discussed. The overall methodology of the paper is a mixture of mostly classical with some behavioral economics.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
K23|Basel III: In quest for criteria and scenarios of the banking regulation reform advancement|The article looks into the spillover effect of the sweeping overhaul of financial regulation, also known as Basel III, for credit institutions. We found that new standards of capital adequacy will inevitably put downward pressure on ROE that in turn will further diminish post-crisis recovery of the banking industry. Under these circumstances, resilience of systemically important banks could be maintained through cost optimization, repricing, and return to homogeneity of their operating models, while application of macroprudential regulation by embedding it into new regulatory paradigm would minimize the effect of risk multiplication at micro level. Based on the research we develop recommendations for financial regulatory reform in Russia and for shaping integrated banking regulation in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).
K23|The legal framework applicable to joint interpretive agreements of investment treaties|Governments have been examining the potential role of joint government interpretations of investment treaties at OECD-hosted intergovernmental investment roundtables. Now well-established in the model BITs and treaty practice of the NAFTA governments, express provisions for such joint interpretations have recently been included in an increasing range of treaties and investment policies around the world. But while a significant number of major recent treaties contain such express provisions, most investment treaties do not expressly address joint interpretations and thus leave the issue to more general rules. This paper addresses the general legal framework applicable to joint agreements by treaty parties about the interpretation of treaties. It outlines some key concepts and distinctions in treaty interpretation, and then considers the effects of treaty interpretations and amendments on third parties and in particular on investors covered by a treaty. Joint government interpretation can be binding or non-binding on investment arbitration tribunals. The paper concludes with brief consideration of possible criteria that could affect the persuasiveness of non-binding guidance.
K23|State-to-State dispute settlement and the interpretation of investment treaties|Many governments have expressed concerns about the uncertainty linked to the perceived inconsistency of treaty interpretation in Investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS). An OECD-hosted intergovernmental investment roundtable has been considering a range of tools through which governments can take action to improve the interpretation of investment treaties and some participants suggested consideration of the potential role of State-to-State dispute settlement (SSDS) in this area. This paper responds to this interest. The first part sets forth a rough typology of possible SSDS claims under investment treaties. The second part outlines policy issues relating to a possible type of SSDS claim which would be most relevant to the question of interpretation, for so-called “pure” interpretation of an investment treaty. The analysis seeks to identify policy reasons why governments might wish to provide for or exclude the power to obtain pure interpretations of investment treaties from SSDS tribunals or to make it broad or narrow. The final section examines SSDS cases under investment treaties addressing claims for interpretation.
K23|Structural reforms to boost inclusive growth in Greece|This paper takes stock of the main structural reforms that Greece has undertaken since 2010, those currently proposed and that are in the process of implementation, and quantifies the medium and long‑term effects on output. Special attention is given to three issues that are relevant to understanding reform dynamics in Greece: i) the short-term impact of reforms; ii) the effect of some reforms on income inequality and other socioeconomic outcomes; iii) implementation problems that might undermine the ability of structural reforms to deliver their expected outcomes. The reforms, if fully implemented, could raise output by more than 13% over the next decade. Reforms in product markets are particularly important in boosting growth. Poverty and inequality have increased despite policies to mitigate the social impacts of Greece’s deep depression since 2009. Better social policies are needed to strengthen the social safety net and make growth more inclusive. Much of the burden of adjustment has been borne by labour. Labour market institutions should balance the objectives of increasing jobs, reallocating workers to where they can earn the most, and ensuring the fruits of the economic recovery are widely shared. Des réformes structurelles pour une croissance inclusive en Grèce Ce document a pour objet de faire le point sur les principales réformes structurelles que la Grèce a engagées depuis 2010, tant celles qui sont actuellement proposées que celles qui sont en cours de mise en oeuvre, et de chiffrer les effets à moyen et à long terme de ces réformes sur la production. Une attention particulière est accordée aux trois aspects qui comptent pour appréhender la dynamique des réformes en Grèce : i) les effets à court terme des réformes ; ii) les effets de certaines réformes sur les inégalités de revenu et sur d’autres résultats socioéconomiques ; iii) les difficultés de mise en oeuvre qui pourraient compromettre l’obtention des résultats attendus des réformes structurelles. Si elles sont pleinement mises en oeuvre, les réformes pourraient permettre d’accroître la production de plus de 13 % au cours des dix prochaines années. Les réformes des marchés de produits sont particulièrement importantes pour la dynamisation de la croissance. La pauvreté et les inégalités se sont aggravées malgré les mesures prises pour atténuer les conséquences sociales de la profonde dépression dans laquelle la Grèce est plongée depuis 2009. Il faut améliorer les politiques sociales pour renforcer le système de protection sociale et rendre la croissance plus inclusive. Le fardeau de l’ajustement a reposé pour une bonne partie sur la main-d’oeuvre. Il conviendrait que les institutions du marché du travail parviennent à concilier les objectifs que sont la création d’emplois, le redéploiement des travailleurs vers les emplois les mieux rémunérés et un large partage des fruits de la reprise économique.
K23|Trade-Related International Regulatory Co-operation: A Theoretical Framework|This report provides a conceptual foundation for the analysis of international regulatory co-operation (IRC) and its potential benefits through reduced trade costs. Different forms of IRC aiming to reduce specification, conformity assessment and information costs - which can arise from regulatory heterogeneity, costly conformity assessment procedures and insufficient regulatory transparency – are addressed. The report argues that trade costs need to be balanced against the regulatory objectives of mitigating various market imperfections. Integrating these two elements often allows significant gains in terms of national welfare, gains that can be augmented by negotiated outcomes among trading partners. IRC may also have important effects on trade with third countries. Related welfare implications are, however, ambiguous and depend on the specifics of the IRC outcome as well as on third countries’ own regulations.
K23|Product Liability versus Reputation|"Market reputation is often perceived as a cheaper alternative to product liability in the provision of safety incentives. We explore the interaction between legal and reputational sanctions using the idea that inducing safety through reputation requires implementing costly ""market sanctioning"" mechanisms. We show that law positively affects the functioning of market reputation by reducing its costs. We also show that reputation and product liability are not just substitutes but also complements. We analyze the effects of different legal policies, and namely that negligence reduces reputational costs more intensely than strict liability, and that court errors in determining liability interfere with reputational cost reduction through law. A more general result is that any variant of an ex post liability rule will improve the functioning of market reputation in isolation. We complicate the basic analysis with endogenous prices and observability by consumers of the outcome of court’s decisions. (JEL K13, K23, L51, H24)"
K23|Organizational Capacity, Regulatory Review, and the Limits of Political Control|Studies of administrative politics focus primarily on political control and ignore organizational capacity. We argue that political and organizational factors, as well as the interaction between the two, are necessary for explaining executive policymaking. To test this theory, we consider the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), an agency often perceived to be the president’s political instrument. Using a new dataset of over 22,000 regulations reviewed by OIRA, we demonstrate that political factors influence review lengths, but organizational factors also exhibit a significant role. We find that reviews are longer when OIRA is understaffed and over-worked. Significantly, we demonstrate that low organizational capacity inhibits the president’s ability to expedite priority rules. Overall, this study highlights the organizational limits of political control. (JEL H11, H83, K23, L50, L51, M50)
K23|Congressional Assertions of the Spending Power: Institutional Conflict and Regulatory Authority|This study seeks to answer a crucial and unexplored question about American regulatory law and policy: How do majority coalitions in Congress use the spending power to circumvent intra-branch conflict and judicial constraints against regulating by finding alternate avenues to regulate states and private actors? This study provides the first large-scale empirical evidence of congressional use of the spending power to assert implementation authority in the face of constraints against more direct legislating. It is through this process of conditioning funds upon regulatory compliance that Congress works toward ideal policy outcomes without inciting institutional conflict with the other branches or from the opposing party. I base my conditional spending analysis on data on statutory specificity and congressional delegation from the 80th to the 110th Congresses provided by Farhang, and include additional measures of institutional conflict. The above argument is supported by the empirical analysis. (JEL K20, K23)
K23|Some Aspects Concerning the Concept of Rent in the Romanian Law|"The notion of rent was analyzed through the ages by both lawyers and economists generically representing an equivalent to the lack of use due to the owner of the property by the person who benefits from that good and form of profit that can be obtained by the owner of a good from the person exploiting the good. The interest that this issue presents refers to the location of each of these types of understanding the concept of rent in areas where it is found and used to get to know the specifics and peculiarities of this term. Whether we speak of ""ground rent"" or ""land rent"" or ""farm rent"", we will consider the real legal relationships of the property, regarding the relationship between the land owner to the other people, who must adopt a certain behavior towards the owner and his/her good."
K23|Discusions Concernant L’Élection Du Président Du Conseil Départemental En Roumanie|Conformément à la Constitution de 1991, révisée, le conseil départemental est l’autorité de l’administration publique locale pour la coordination de l’activité des conseils communaux et des villes, en raison d’accomplissement des services publiques d’intérêt départemental, ayant élu et fonctionnant dans les conditions de la loi. Dans la Constitution on ne retrouve de dispositions sur l’élection et le statut du président du conseil départemental. Dans la première Loi de l’administration publique locale no. 69/1991 on stipulait l’élection indirecte du président du conseil départemental, même des vice-présidents, parmi les membres du conseil départemental, sur la durée du mandat. Le même procédé est maintenu dans les dispositions de la Loi de l’administration publique locale no. 215/2001, dans la version initiale, le président du conseil départemental et les deux vice-présidents étant choisis sur la toute durée du mandat avec le vote secret des conseillers en fonction. La situation a été changée radicalement en 2008, quand par la modification de la Loi no. 67/2004 pour l’élection des autorités de l’administration publique locale, on renonce au système de vote indirect et pour la première fois depuis 1990, on prévoit que le président du conseil départemental est élu par suffrage universel, égal, direct, secret et librement exprimé. Des détails sur ce sujet, par exemple, la procédure de validation, le vœu déposé etc., étaient réglementés dans les textes de la Loi no. 215/2001, republiée, avec les modifications ultérieures. Étonnamment, récemment, par la Loi no.115/2015 on modifie les dispositions légales et on revient au processus initial, l’élection indirecte du président du conseil départemental, au scrutin secret, à la majorité simple des conseillers. Déjà, certains politiciens ont émis des réserves, disant que l’élection indirecte du président par les conseillers départementaux peut donner lieu à occulte compréhension, fondée sur des intérêts plus ou moins légitimes. A nôtre avis, l'élection directe du président du conseil départemental par un vote direct des électeurs du département était une procédure démocratique qui donnait celui-ci une plus grande légitimité. En même temps, dans le système d’élection directe par les électeurs, le président du conseil départemental s’assumait une responsabilité augmenté pour les programmes qu'il propose au cours de la campagne électorale. En conclusion, nous considérons que le retour au système d'élection indirecte est une mesure discutable, avec des conséquences directes en ce qui concerne le statut et la nature juridique de l’institution du président du conseil départemental.
