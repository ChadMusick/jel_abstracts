R19|Cities of Workers, Children or Seniors? Age Structure and Economic Growth in a Global Cross-Section of Cities|A large literature documents the positive influence of a cityâ€™s skill structure on its rate of economic growth. By contrast, the effect of a cityâ€™s age structure on its economic growth has been a hitherto largely neglected area of research. We hypothesize that cities with more working-age adults are likely to grow faster than cities with more children or seniors and set-out the potential channels through which such differential growth may occur. Using data from a variety of historical and contemporary sources, we show that there exists marked variation in the age structure of the worldâ€™s largest cities, both across cities and over time. We then study how age structure affects economic growth for a global cross-section of mega-cities. Using various identification strategies, we find that mega-cities with higher dependency ratios - i.e. with more children and/or seniors per working-age adult - grow significantly slower. Such effects are particularly pronounced for cities with high shares of children. This result appears to be mainly driven by the direct negative effects of a higher dependency ratio on the size of the working-age population and the indirect effects on work hours and productivity for working age adults within a city.
R19|Residents’ Coproduction Activities As The Basis Of Urban Development: The Case Of The Football World Cup In Volgograd|Coproduction is a practice that encourages active interaction between customers and producers in creating products, services or events. In the urban management framework the above-mentioned concept is just starting to be put into practice and is characterized by the involvement of residents in different city activities' organization including mega events managed by local authorities. The new types of interaction between residents and authorities include participation of residents as volunteers in organization and carrying out of different city events and activities, mass collaboration or crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, recommendations to external stakeholders, couchsurfing, and slum tourism. The article examines the theoretical aspects of coproduction concept introduction in urban development, describes the types of interaction between residents and local authorities as well as the benefits of this interaction. The author has developed and empirically verified a conceptual model for willingness assessment of residents to participate in coproduction of mega events based on the example of the city of Volgograd which hosted one of the Football World Cup stages.
R19|Human-Capital Externalities in China|This paper provides evidences of heterogeneous human-capital externality using CHIP 2002, 2007 and 2013 data from urban China. After instrumenting city-level education using the number of relocated university departments across cities in the 1950s, one year more city-level education increases individual hourly wage by 22.0 percent, more than twice the OLS estimate. Human-capital externality is found to be greater for all groups of urban residents in the instrumental variable estimation.
R19|Job Search and Labor Market Outcomes of New Graduates in China: Using the Latest Available Survey Data|This is the first study that uses data collected after the new reform of the household registration system (hukou) on the topic of job search and labor market outcomes of new graduates in China. Data of recent years were collected via an original survey. Results indicate a significant, positive effect of search effort on finding a job, which was rarely observed before the reform. Furthermore, parents¡¯ income contributes significantly to starting wage, but has no significant effect on finding a job. This could be because parents¡¯ income is the source of major financial support for unemployed new graduates in China, theoretically contributing to wages but not affecting job-labor match. Moreover, the study examined details related to graduates¡¯ human capital and found that participation in university activities contributes to higher levels of starting wage upon graduation. The effects of different methods of job search were also examined. In addition, contrary to previous studies using data before the new hukou reform, this study found no significant wage gap between urban hukou graduates and rural hukou graduates.
R19|Central Place Analysis|Central place analysis is a collection of theoretical and empirical attempts, originated from the Central Place Theory by Christaller (1933) and Lösch (1940), aiming to explain the spatial coordination of the provision of goods and services. The goods and services whose production is subject to scale economies are called central goods, and they are supplied from central places, typically towns and cities. The degree of scale economies associated with each central good determines the hinterland size of each central place. The central places supplying the goods associated with larger scale economies are called higher-order central places. The theory predicts the spatial coordination of central places leading to the hierarchy principle which asserts that each central place supplies all goods provided in lower-order central places, and the spacing-out property that central places of a given order are equally spaced.
R19|Agglomeration|This article provides a review of selected researches on the mechanism, spatial scale and spatial distribution of economic agglomeration. It starts with a classification of the existing models of agglomeration in terms of the sources of agglomeration force suggested by the Spatial Impossibility Theorem by Starrett (1978). It then discusses the tension between economies and diseconomies of agglomeration. Finally it briefly touches on the measures of agglomeration and dynamic aspect of agglomeration.
R19|Spatial pattern of Russia’s market integration|This paper studies integration of regional goods markets in Russia over 2001–2015 with the use of time series analysis, based on the law of one price as the criterion of market integration. The cost of a staples basket is used as a price representative. The analysis involves all pairs of country’s regions, thus providing a comprehensive pattern of market integration. The region pairs are classified as belonging to one of four groups: integrated, conditionally integrated, not integrated but tending towards integration, and neither integrated nor tending towards integration. The results suggest that only less than a quarter of region pairs fall into the fourth category.
R19|European Union and Romanian Tourism – ß and s Convergence in the Economic Development Regions of Romania|At present, both in Romania and in Europe, tourism tends to become one of the biggest industries, with great development possibilities in the future. The economic development of Romania including tourism benefits from the support of the European Union, and has the purpose to reduce the gaps in this concern, compared to both the European Union average and more developed countries. The purpose of this paper is to analyse ß and s convergence in the 8 Economic Development Regions of Romania by a tourism approach. The concept of ß-convergence represents the process of quicker development of poor regions than the rich ones, and s-convergence is evaluating the process of decrease of regional economic disparities in time. The analysis based on ß-convergence was performed using econometric modelling techniques of linear correlation. For s-convergence, we measured the dispersion of real GDPT per in habitant by the use of the variation coefficient t ? . The purpose is to check the hypothesis according to which the ß-convergence approach and the s- convergence concept can lead to different results for the Economic Development Regions of Romania. The period analysed is between 2007 and 2013.
R19|Neoliberalism, Urbanization and Change in Africa|"In the much of the popular media, the discourse around Africa has changed. Whereas stories of the ""coming anarchy"" or the ""hopeless continent"" abounded a little over a decade ago, it was, until the recent collapse in commodity prices, increasingly seen as the final global investment frontier, with rapid uptake of cellular technology and economic growth. Although much of this growth has been propelled by natural resources, the current conjuncture offers opportunities as well as challenges for African urban areas and raises questions about the role of cities in the continent's future development as they continue to become more deeply informalised. The response of many city authorities to the deepening informalisation of their economies has been to try to connect to the global economy in new ways, through the creation of new financial service, high-tech and elite residential areas. In this paper we explore these developments through the Foucaudian lens of heterotopia. These new developments attempt to erase their associations with the cities from which they originate in favour of new connections outwards. However the creation of these new enclaves is filled with socio-spatial contradictions, which make them unlikely to achieve their ostensible objectives."
R19|Multilevel empirics for small banks in local markets|Small banks are embedded in narrow markets and hence benefit from proximity to their customers. By referring to multilevel approach, this paper evaluates how much the performance of Italian mutual co‐operative banks is determined by geographical and individual characteristics. The effect of local markets explains 28.27 per cent of bank heterogeneity in the empty multilevel model and 33 per cent in the most extended model. Moreover, it is found that efficiency increases with market concentration and demand density but decreases with branching in local markets. Los bancos pequeños están arraigados en mercados pequeños y, por lo tanto, se benefician de la proximidad a sus clientes. Con referencia al enfoque multinivel, este artículo evalúa el grado en que el desempeño de los bancos cooperativos mutualistas italianos está determinado por características geográficas e individuales. El efecto de los mercados locales explica el 28,27 por ciento de la heterogeneidad bancaria en el modelo multinivel vacío y el 33 por ciento en el modelo más amplio. Además, se encontró que la eficiencia aumenta con la concentración del mercado y la densidad de la demanda, pero disminuye con las sucursales en los mercados locales. 小規模銀行(small bank)は小規模のマーケットに入り込んでおり、顧客との近接性から恩恵を得ている。本稿では、マルチレベルアプローチを参照して、イタリアの相互扶助の協同組合銀行(mutual co‐operative bank)の業績が、地理学的特色と銀行別の特色によって、どの程度決定されるのかを評価する。現地のマーケットの効果は、銀行の異質性が、空のマルチレベルモデルでは27‐28%、最も拡張したモデルでは33%となることを示している。また、マーケットの規模と需要密度とともに効率は上がるが、地域のマーケットが事業拡大すると効率は下がることも認められた。
R19|Does localized imitation drive technology adoption? A case study on rooftop photovoltaic systems in Germany|The purpose of this paper is to illuminate the spatio-temporal diffusion of rooftop household photovoltaic installations in Germany and to test whether localized imitation drives their adoption. Our study is based on a unique data set of some 576,000 household photovoltaic systems installed in Germany through 2009. We employ an epidemic diffusion model which includes a spatial dimension, and control for temporal and spatial heterogeneity. According to our results, imitative adoption behavior is highly localized and an important factor for the diffusion of household photovoltaic systems.
R19|Dominating factors contributing to the high(er) costs for public bus transports in Sweden|The purpose of this study is to deepen the understanding of what are the underlying reasons for the increasing cost of public transport in general and bus services in particular in a Swedish context. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with managers at the bus operators as well as the authority organizations. This paper contributes by identifying nine categories that can be the dominating factors behind the increasing costs of public bus services in Sweden. The identified categories of cost drivers are; of traffic appearance (peak times), greening of buses, age requirements, the contract period, the accessibility customization, special requirements on buses, collective agreements (working time regulation), tendering and contracting process, and finally, counterproductive political governance. It can be concluded that many of the cost drivers originate from the circumstances of the process of public procurement, such as different demands for different regions in Sweden as well as the trade-off between the bus operators' wishes for higher flexibility in the contracts and the traffic authorities' fear of more risks and thereby higher bids in the end.
R19|“Porter vs Krugman”: History, Analysis and Critique of Regional Competitiveness|"The subject of this study is to determine the competitiveness through an interdisciplinary approach of the theories of the new economic geography and regional economy. This article describes in detail the theory of competitiveness, which is defined differently by many authors, with particular emphasis on opposing views of Michael Porter and Paul Krugman. One of the first writers who stressed the importance of the geographical position was Michael Porter. In his model, the author emphasizes that the geographical concentration of firms enhances productivity, innovation and export sector. Following this theory, many authors have focused on the research of the ""location problem "", which led to better connection of economics and geography. The result of these activities is the new guidelines that have been developed, such as the new theory of economic geography and regional economy. The new economic geography is mainly related to the Nobel prized, Paul Krugman, whose theories often conflict with those of Porter. This study initially sets out the views of both authors, in terms of competitiveness and then attempts to make a comparative analysis between the theories they developed."
R19|The Path-Dependence Bias in Approximating Local Price Levels by CPIs|Lacking data on price levels across locations, economists are forced to proxy them. One method is to extrapolate the price levels known for locations in some point in time to another point by multiplying the initial price levels by the local CPIs. With the use of simulation experiments, this paper demonstrates that such a method is inadequate, since the path dependence of CPI alone produces considerable biases distorting cross-location comparisons of price levels.
R19|Modele „srebrnej gospodarki” w Unii Europejskiej w ujęciu porównawczym. Próba wprowadzenia do dyskusji<BR>[“Silver Economy” Models in the European Union in the Comparative Approach: An Attempt to Introduce Discussion]|Jednym ze zjawisk związanych z procesem starzenia się społeczeństw są przemiany systemów gospodarczych zorientowane na produkcję i dystrybucję dóbr i usług dla osób starszych, jak również dla młodszych grup wiekowych w ramach ich przygotowania do starości. Artykuł przybliża główne cechy koncepcji „srebrnej gospodarki” w kontekście realizacji polityki aktywnego starzenia się. Opracowanie przedstawia typologię modeli srebrnej gospodarki w krajach Unii Europejskiej na poziomach krajowym i regionalnym na podstawie wykorzystania porównań indeksu aktywnego starzenia się (Active Ageing Index) do typologii zróżnicowań i kultur kapitalizmu oraz typologii państw dobrobytu. W podsumowaniu przybliżono wnioski dla działań praktycznych oraz propozycje dalszych kierunków badań. ** Some phenomena associated with ageing populations are transition of economies to focus more on the production and distribution of goods and services for older adults as well as for younger age groups as part of their preparation for old age. The paper presents the main features of the concept of “silver economy” in the context of active ageing policies. The study presents a typology of the silver economy models in the European Union at national and regional levels based on the use of the Active Ageing Index in comparison to the typology of differences and cultures of capitalism as well as the typology of welfare states. The summary contains conclusions for practical interventions and proposals for further research.
R19|Comparative Analysis of National and Regional Models of the Silver Economy in the European Union|The approach to analysing population ageing and its impacts on the economy has evolved in recent years. There is increasing interest in the development and use of products and services related to gerontechnology as well as other social innovations that may be considered as central parts of the “silver economy.” However, the concept of silver economy is still being formed and requires detailed research. This article proposes a typology of models of the silver economy in the European Union (EU) at the national and regional levels. This typology was created by comparing the Active Ageing Index to the typology of varieties and cultures of capitalism and typology of the welfare states. Practical recommendations for institutions of the EU and directions for further research are discussed.
R19|Local Labour System After the Turn of the Millennium in Hungary|The current research puts the issue of functional urban regions (or districts) into the focus delimited by the commuting network of employees. The local labour system (LLS) provided a specific dimension of this complex approach however it is one of the most adequate possibilities to delineate these areas of commuting. The delimitation process consisted of two steps with the separation of employment centres and with the assignment of settlements to these cores. The alteration of the LLS pattern was also analysed as the investigation was carried out by the census data from 2001 and 2011. The results provided a comprehensive overview about the process of territorial concentration and the instability of peripheral areas. Significant regional disparities of commuting came to light as the consequence of the body of settlement network. The territorial division of the country provided by LLS pattern is fitting to the new and integrated European approach of cities and their hinterlands but it is not alternative against other administrative or statistical divisions of Hungary. However this territorial point of view is in closer relation to the issues of analysing the local labour market processes or the developments targeting the increase in employment.
R19|Understanding the Changing Geography of Labour-Intensive Industries from a GPN Perspective: Case Study of the Hungarian Leather and Footwear Sector|Labour-intensive industries have declined in the East Central European economy after the beginning of the millennium. Given this deterioration, significant employers are vanishing from rural areas, leaving behind serious employment problems in regions which are less capable of resilient restructuring. This article examines this shrinkage from a geographical aspect in the context of the Hungarian leather and footwear industry. This study focuses on the interpretation and explanation of the spatial differentiation that accompanies this shrinking process. The aim of this paper is to reveal the influencing factors that stand in the background of spatially uneven development. The analysis – embedded in the theoretical framework of global production networks – is based on the corporate database of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office and invokes the experience of interviews carried out with representatives of industrial actors as well. In addition to an understanding of spatial processes, the intention of the authors was to investigate the issues to be addressed in certain locations and under what conditions the long-standing industrial culture related to the sector can be preserved.
R19|The Vulnerability of Polish Regions to the Challenges of the Modern Economy|The paper deals with the conditions affecting the economic growth of Poland`s regions. Research questions are initially formulated about regularities and factors contributing to the economic success of Polish regions after their market-oriented transition. Changes in the theoretical foundations of regional policy are then discussed as well as the contribution of the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the European Union (EU) to the new doctrine. The global and European megatrends of recent decades - unfavorable to regions in EU member states, in part due to the 2008+ crisis - are described. The European cohesion policy, a unique solution globally to support regional development, plays a major role in the socioeconomic development of Poland`s regions. Poland is the EU`s biggest beneficiary of this policy, which is now oriented toward boosting regional competitiveness. Polish regions are steadily becoming stronger within the EU, as this paper demonstrates, with the best growth trajectories enjoyed by the strongest regions. The impact of the 2008+ recession on Polish regions was limited, largely thanks to quality public policies. This good trajectory may be hard to achieve in the future due to what is known as the middle-income trap. Therefore, adjustments have to be made in Polish regional policy and other policies to make regions less vulnerable to the volatility of socioeconomic development.

Calculation results for each region of Russian Federation are listed in an application.
R19|Bubbles in US regional house prices: evidence from house price–income ratios at the State level| We investigate the presence of bubbles in the US house price-income ratio at the State level by applying the recent time series-based econometric test to data from January 1975 to December 2014. We find evidence of bubbles in several States in the 1980s (i.e. California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, etc.), which coincides with some existing studies that investigate housing bubbles or booms and busts using a range of alternative approaches. Our results show the existence of a housing bubble that originates in the early 2000s and collapses in the mid-2000s in more than 20 States and the District of Columbia concluding that the bubbles of the 2000s were more widespread than the 1980s, which is of special interest and importance. Our results seem to be in agreement with the talk given by Alan Greenspan in 2005, who suggest no sign of a nationwide housing bubble but a lot of local bubbles. We also study the importance of the regression model specification with/without an intercept and the regression model with an intercept could lead to false-positive identification of bubbles.
R19|Climate and Happiness in the Tropics|Despite the increasing number of studies on self-reported happiness, due to data availability, only a few studies from developing countries exist. Moreover, even though climate is among the most important input to human activities, only a handfull of studies explicitly associate it with self-reported wellbeing. This paper combines a survey of 17,000 individuals representing 85% of Indonesian population and GIS data on local climate to establish a causation between climate variables (temperature and rainfalls) on individual subjective well-being. We found that happiness is not associated with temperature, as expected because tropical country like Indonesia does not have much temperature variation. However, rainfall is found to significantly associated with self-reported happiness. We found that the relationship is not linear, where higher rainfall is associated with more happiness but it reduces it after some point. Policy implications are discussed.
R19|Impact Of A Disaster On Land Price: Evidence From Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant Accident|The Great East Japan Earthquake, which occurred on March 11, 2011, triggered the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident. This study estimates the economic damage caused by the radioactive contamination from the plant using a hedonic approach. Our estimation results show that an increase of 1μSv∕h decreases the land price by 3.39% on average in Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures. Specifically, damage due to the radiation effect is estimated to cost approximately 64.1 billion yen in Fukushima. In addition, our result shows that commercial and business areas are more sensitive than residential areas to the radiation quantity.

R19|Threshold transitions in a regional urban system|In this paper we analyze the evolution of city size distributions over time in a regional urban system. This urban complex system is in constant flux with changing groups and city migration across existing and newly created groups. Using group formation as an emergent property, transition probabilities across the different groups were calculated. While short-term transition appears chaotic in the intermediate and lower rank groups, long-term transition across all rank groups reveals striking system structure over time.

R19|The Competitiveness of Colombian Departments: An Analysis from the Economic Geography Perspective|This article examines regional competitiveness from a geographical perspective, and constructs a competitiveness ranking for Colombian departments using principal components and hierarchical cluster techniques. The analysis shows that competitiveness becomes meaningless when it is applied to the goods market, but is meaningful when one considers the market and the mobility of production factors. The analysis also shows, unlike most approaches and measures of competitiveness for Colombian departments, that it is possible to obtain simple measures, which in addition to being consistent with the conceptual framework of economic geography, is the product of the combination of a small number of variables.
R19|Food markets in Russia: dynamics of their integration|In the context of an integrated market, a price of any product in regions depends on its demand in a national market rather than in a regional one. Applying the econometric model based on this theoretical statement, the paper assesses to what degree the markets of some food products are integrated. The fact that since nearly 1994 the growth of segmentation in such markets changes to the tendency of their integration has been observed. The authors conclude that there is an integrated food market in Russia, and its integration has been just the same as that one in the counties of developed market economy.
