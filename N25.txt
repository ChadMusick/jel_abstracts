N25|China's overseas lending|"Compared with China's dominance in world trade, its expanding role in global finance is poorly documented and understood. Over the past decades, China has exported record amounts of capital to the rest of the world. Many of these financial flows are not reported to the IMF, the BIS or the World Bank. ""Hidden debts"" to China are especially significant for about three dozen developing countries, and distort the risk assessment in both policy surveillance and the market pricing of sovereign debt. We establish the size, destination, and characteristics of China's overseas lending. We identify three key distinguishing features.First, almost all of China's lending and investment abroad is official. As a result, the standard ""push"" and ""pull"" drivers of private cross-border flows do not play the same role in this case. Second, the documentation of China's capital exports is (at best) opaque. China does not report on its official lending and there is no comprehensive standardized data on Chinese overseas debt stocks and flows. Third, the type of flows is tailored by recipient. Advanced and higher middle-income countries tend to receive portfolio debt flows, via sovereign bond purchases of the People's Bank of China. Lower income developing economies mostly receive direct loans from China's state-owned banks, often at market rates and backed by collateral such as oil. Our new dataset covers a total of 1,974 Chinese loans and 2,947 Chinese grants to 152 countries from 1949 to 2017. We find that about one half of China's overseas loans to the developing world are ""hidden""."
N25|Towards Financial Inclusion in South Asia: A Youth and Gender Perspective|The youthful population of South Asia, having almost one-third of the population below the age of 15 years old, seems also to have a great share in the future alongside the risk of being NEET with a persisting gender gap. This makes important for South Asian countries to put a gender-responsive policy framework for the youth empowerment at the heart of their efforts towards the 2030 Agenda. Increasing youth’s financial inclusion at the individual level would also provide development benefits especially for developing and least developed countries. This paper, after constructing a multidimensional financial inclusion index, shows evidence on how to increase the formal financial inclusion among the South Asian youth considering also gendered effects and it provides policy recommendations accordingly.
N25|Did the Arab Spring Reduce MENA Countries' Growth?|This paper examines the economic ramifications of the recent political reconfigurations that the MENA region witnessed, commonly known as the Arab Spring, utilizing MENA countries data during period 2005-2016. Using the Arellano-Bond dynamic panel estimation, the paper estimates a growth model using the difference in the log of GDPC between periods t and t+1. Buttressed by sufficient empirical evidence, the paper's findings corroborate that the Arab Spring had been negatively associated with growth.
N25|Market-based Financing Reforms and Shareholder Valuations: Event Study Evidence from the Chinese Science and Technology Innovation Board|This paper studies the impact of the newly introduced science and technology innovation board (STIB) on stock valuations in China. This Nasdaq-style board features a market-based IPO system that contrasts with the current approved-based arrangement. Event study approach shows that A-share firms pertaining to STIB related industries increased significantly after the reform announcement. The effect is stronger for Non-SOEs and firms with higher R&D capacity. Public shareholders of the firms filing STIB IPO applications experienced salient growth in their abnormal returns while their industry competitors suffered price drops. Financial analysts also broadened their company coverages in STIB related industries and revised their market valuation forecasts positively in line with the market investors.

N25|Drivers and constraints of state confiscation of elite property in the Ottoman Empire, 1750-1839|This paper examines the motives, timing and informal constraints of state confiscation in the Ottoman Empire, focusing on one of its most turbulent and confiscatory periods, 1750-1839. Utilizing a new dataset uncovered from confiscation inventories, I first demonstrate that confiscations were practiced on a selective basis, targeting some office-holders and tax farmers. Second, employing a two-step econometric framework inspired by the gradual nature of Ottoman confiscations, I argue that the initial decision whether to send an agent to confiscate one’s wealth was driven mainly by severity of war and expected costs of confiscation, while attributes of wealth and bargaining power of families vis-à-vis the central administration shaped the outcome of the second step.
N25|The economics of Edwardian imperial preference: what can New Zealand reveal?|In the Edwardian era, the British Dominions adopted policies of imperial preference, amid a period of rising imports from the United States and industrial Continental Europe. Hitherto, there has been no econometric assessment of whether these policies produced an intra-Empire trade diversion, as intended. This paper focuses on New Zealand’s initial policy of imperial preference, codified in the Preferential and Reciprocal Trade Act of 1903. New Zealand’s policy was unique insofar as it extended preference to only certain commodities. Using a commodity panel regression, this paper exploits the cross-commodity variation in the extension of preference, but finds no statistically significant effect of preference on either the Empire share or, specifically, the British share of New Zealand’s imports. This finding is corroborated by an alternative empirical approach involving propensity-score matching.
N25|Heterogeneity Of Financial Institutions In The Process Of Economic And Monetary Integration In East Asia|The paper aims to assess the influence of the heterogeneity of financial institutions in the relationship between bilateral trade and the monetary integration process in East Asia. I used a structural gravity model with similarity of currency regimes and I introduced a heterogeneity of financial institutions variable derived from the World Bank Financial Development and Structure Dataset. The hypothesis is that the more heterogeneous financial institutions are, the less bilateral trade there is. The results show a negative relationship between trade and the heterogeneity of the financial institutions. The similarity of currency regimes has a negative effect on bilateral trade, and that effect increases with the presence of the financial institutions variable. I made a second estimation concerning 184 countries and territories and I replaced the similarity of currency regimes with a standard currency dummy. The results confirmed the negative and significant relationship between the heterogeneity of the financial institutions and trade. The recent reform plans of ASEAN countries should also consider these aspects, which are not limited to financial integration problems.
N25|Deficit financing in developing countries: Application and consequences|This article discusses briefly various aspects and forms of deficit financing in modern economies. It deals with deficit financing (i) within countries and (ii) between the member countries of the International Monetary Fund (IMF} and that institution as aid provider to a member in difficulty. In (i) it focuses mainly on the use of deficit financing as an instrument to part fund development and its consequences. In (ii) it sees deficit financing on a global scale, explains IMF conditionality and the sort of programs it envisaged the aid seeking members to follow; it presents illustration and critique of these programs. In conclusion it contains some observations including a few policy suggestions
N25|The formalization of banking supervision: A comparison between Japan and Sweden|This study examines the formalization of banking supervision in Japan and Sweden that occurred in the decades around 1900. Using an incremental change approach, the respective cases are traced and examined from three dimensions: 1) the legal framework, 2) the banking supervisory agency, and 3) bank supervisory activities. As a result of the comparative analysis, we find several similarities and differences. The most important finding is that the two cases are similar, in that financial crises - generally considered to be a primary driver for major regulatory and supervisory reforms - did not play the main role in the formalization of supervision in either Japan or Sweden. Rather, the formalization was an incremental adjustment to the organic development of the banking sector, the general public's increasing exposure to the banks as deposit holders and borrowers, and the increased need for professionalization of the banking sector.
N25|Lending without creditor rights, collateral, or reputation : The “trusted assistant” loan in 19th century China|This paper considers lending to finance projects in a setting where repayment enforcement appears impossible. The loan was illegal and thus legally unenforceable. Creditors were incapable of applying private coercion to force repayment. Borrowers lacked both collateral and reputation capital. Project cash flows were unobservable. The projects were the acquisition of Imperial administrative posts by scholars in nineteenth century Qing China. The lending mechanism was the “trusted-assistant loan.” Our model of trusted-assistant lending shows that it is a renegotiation-proof implementation of efficient state dependent financing. Empirical analysis of officials’ diaries and bank records shows that the employment of trusted-assistant lending and the performance of trusted-assistant loans conforms roughly with the model’s predictions.
N25|The Rise of a Financial Revolution in Republican China in 1900-1937: an Institutional Narrative|This paper surveys the phenomenal transformation of banking and finance, public debt and monetary regimes during 1900-1937, a period of great political instability in Chinese history. To understand why sectors which are often most vulnerable to the security of property rights and contract enforcement, have become the vanguard of growth in such an era of uncertainty, I highlight the role of institutions as seen in the form of a business dominated quasi-political structure that grew outside the formal political sphere. This structure rested on the institutional nexus of Western treaty ports (with Shanghai being the most important) and China Maritime Customs service, a relatively autonomous tax bureaucracy. By ensuring the credibility of repayment of government bonds, this financial-fiscal mechanism laid the institutional foundation for the rise of modern Chinese banks, a viable market for public debt and increasing supply of reputable convertible bank notes. My survey sheds new light on some of the most important and controversial issues related to Chinese and global economic history.
N25|Some Doubts about the Economic Analysis of the Flow of Silver to China in 1550–1820|Abstract The paper takes issue with the mainstream economic analysis of the enormous flow of silver into China in 1550–1820. First, I challenge the view that arbitrage between gold and silver in European trade with China was important except for one twenty-year spell. Next, I argue that had China imported gold, its history would have been much the same. I also dispute the idea that the persistence of the silver inflows from 1550 to 1820 implies any persistent disequilibrium, and I maintain that economic theory can easily accommodate the view that the inflow of silver into China sponsored growth in China.
N25|East Asian Financial and Economic Development|Japan, an isolated, backward country in the 1860s, industrialized rapidly to become a major industrial power by the 1930s. South Korea, among the world’s poorest countries in the 1960s, joined the ranks of First World economies in little over a single generation. China now seems poised to follow a similar trajectory. All three cases highlight the importance of marginalized traditional elites, intensive early investment in education, a degree of economic openness, free markets, equity financing, early-stage coordination of firms in diverse industries via arrangements such as business groups, and political institutions capable of curbing the power of families grown wealthy in early-stage rapid development to make way for prosperity sustained by efficient resource allocation to high-productivity firms.
N25|China's Growing Ties with Middle East: Goals and Objectives|"""Objective –This study evaluates China's rapid growth of economic, trade and investment ties with key Middle Eastern countries and its long term economic, geo-political and strategic goals and objectives, as well as opportunities and limitations in the light of the relative decline of US power and influence in the region. Methodology/Technique – A qualitative research methodology is applied in the study and wide range of secondary sources including articles, papers and online resources are used, analyzed and consulted. Data on trade and investment statistics between China and major Middle Eastern countries are also tabulated and used. Findings – The study concludes that economic and trade interests as well as stable and regular oil and gas supply are the primary consideration in this burgeoning relationship. The study also finds that strategic factors like geopolitical locations, large territories with huge natural resources, rising consumer markets and potential areas of military cooperation and arms sales make the Middle East a more lucrative and attractive partner to China. Novelty –The study looks at the relationship between China and the Middle East."""
N25|Between war and peace: The Ottoman economy and foreign exchange trading at the Istanbul bourse|Between 1914 and 1918, the Ottoman Empire was involved in the First World War, which caused economic disruptions, huge budget deficits, surmounted inflation rates and excessive devaluation of Lira, the Ottoman currency. Based on the value of Lira against the currencies of three selected countries that were not in the war, we focus on the effects of news about the war on the foreign exchange rates at the Istanbul bourse from 1918 to 1919. Our results signify some dates, which match the official announcements of the war events and/or the official treaties.
N25|Effects of reforms and supervisory organizations: Evidence from the Ottoman Empire and the Istanbul bourse|Inefficiencies in fiscal and monetary systems of the Ottoman Empire led to higher debt burden over time and the bankruptcy for the Ottoman state in 1875. To deal with these inefficiencies, reforms were implemented, as supervisory organizations were established during the default period. We ask how investors traded at the Istanbul bourse evaluated the outcomes of these reforms and organizations. We manually collect data on price of the General Debt bond from 1873 to 1883. Using the GARCH methodology, we examine the volatility jumps in return of the bond due to the reforms and supervisory organization in the Ottoman Empire. The volatility changes are indicators for risk perceptions of the investors. Our empirical results support that investors positively responded to foundation of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration and the acceptance of gold standard, heralding the persistent decrease in the risk premia over time. The Ottoman case is instructive for the understanding of today’s economic situation in emerging markets such as Greece, while we could argue that long-lived and comprehensive measures with foreign creditors’ supervision on fiscal and monetary systems matter more for investors’ perceptions. No empirical research studies the impacts of the reforms and supervisory organizations on the Istanbul bourse, as this large dataset has never been used before.
N25|Development Assistance Thinking And Practice – Japan, China And A Pivot To Asia|Official development assistance is being redefined and the calculation method updated. This is partly in response to meeting the financing needs for the new sustainable development goals and partly in response to the emergence of new donors whose policies and practice towards development assistance differs from Western donors. This paper traces development thinking and policies in the post-war era in general and examines Japan and China in particular as these countries have a different approach to development assistance and cooperation.
N25|Does The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Add Anything New To Multilateral Finance In Asia?|This paper analyses the AIIB; its mandate, resources, governance and how it compares to the other multilateral development banks operating in Asia. When China proposed a new multilateral development bank in Asia devoted to infrastructure, there were numerous questions raised. These included whether there was really a need for another development bank, whether the new bank would have sufficiently high environmental and social safeguards and be as transparent as the existing ones. This examines the AIIB in comparison to the existing multilateral development banks in Asia and in particular the ADB with its emphasis on infrastructure. The paper finds that there is certainly a need for more funding but it isn’t clear that it is best met by another multilateral.
N25|Financial Structure of South Korea's Chaebol: A Flow-of-Funds Approach|The chaebol, a South Korean form of business conglomerate, has been a key factor in the country's economic growth. In this study, the chaebol sector is added to the asset-liability matrix derived from a flow-of-funds (FOF) analysis in order to explain the role of the chaebol in the Korean financial system. We find that the power-of-dispersion indices in the asset-oriented system differ between the chaebol and other private corporations. Between 1987 and 2002, the former has increased while the latter has declined. In the case of the chaebol, excess liabilities were reduced, while investments in financial assets were increased. This tendency led to an increase in the power-of-dispersion index in this asset-oriented system. Our previous research found a decrease in this index for the private sector in Korea. However, the index increased for chaebol when the private sector is divided into the chaebol and small/medium-sized corporations in this paper. These results point to a greater concentration of economic power in the chaebol in the Korean financial market.
N25|The presidents of the Bank of Taiwan and their times : background, management and business development : 1899-1925|This paper is the brief history of the Bank of Taiwan (BOT, 台湾銀行) from 1899 to 1925, especially focusing on the first to the fourth presidents who represent the era of the rise and fall of the BOT. The BOT was established by the Japanese government in 1899 as colonial development bank in Taiwan, however they changed the business model to that of an international bank covering mainland China and Southeast Asia in 1910s. This rapid expansionism failed in the early 1920s and the BOT temporarily closed its doors in 1927. The question is how and when these problems occurred and spread in the organization as a result of mismanagement. Through the analysis of their achievements and personal background along with corporate performance and macro history, we are better able to understand the rise and fall of the BOT.
N25|Bank capital and bank lending in the Indonesian banking sector|We used bank-level data of Indonesian commercial banks to examine the role of bank capital in bank lending. Indonesian commercial bank capitalization has improved with the implementation of bank restructuring programs after the Asian financial crisis. The capital adequacy ratio has returned to a sound level; however, bank loan disbursement continues to remain low. We examine the bank lending channel in Indonesian banks and investigate the effects of monetary policy on bank lending through bank capital. The results indicate that a well-capitalized bank can increase its provisions of bank loans while still not responding to monetary policy, excepting non-forex banks.

N25|XV. ve XIX. Yüzyıllar Arasında Osmanlı Para Vakıfları ve Modern Finans Kurumlarının Karşılaştırılması<BR>[A Comparison between Ottoman Cash Waqfs and Modern Financial Institutions between 15th and 19th Centuries]|Most of the services provided by modern states to their citizens today were provided by the waqfs during the Ottoman period. The fact that the influence of Islamic religion on the social life was high was one of the most important factors driving people to establish the waqfs. The waqfs founded by philanthropists financed such social needs as religious services, education and infrastructure. The cash waqfs (CWs) were one of the waqf types that financed the needs of the society. The CWs whose capital was cash money provided financial sources to entrepreneurs who were in need of cash according to Islamic methods. The CWs continued to function until the last period of the Ottomans. That the Ottomans used CWs to carry out the functions of the modern financial institutions of Europe is important to understand the Ottoman economic and financial mentality. By using the primary sources, this study aims to analyze the Ottoman economic mentality through studying CWs. In addition, the financial institutions operating in Europe in the same Günümüzde modern devletler tarafından vatandaşlara sağlanan çoğu hizmetler, Osmanlı döneminde vakıflar tarafından sağlanıyordu. İslâm dininin toplumsal hayat üzerindeki etkisinin yüksek olması insanları vakıf kurmaya iten önemli etkenlerin başında geliyordu. Hayırseverler tarafından kurulan vakıflar, dini hizmetler, eğitim, altyapı vb. toplumsal ihtiyaçları finanse etmekteydi. Para vakıfları, toplumun ihtiyaçlarını finanse eden vakıf türlerinden birisidir. Sermayesi nakit paradan oluşan bu vakıflar ihtiyacı olan girişimcilere İslâmî usullere göre finansman sağlamıştır. Para vakıfları Osmanlıların son dönemlerine kadar işleyişini devam ettiren kurumlar olmuştur. Osmanlıların, aynı dönemde Avrupa’daki modern finansal kurumların gelişmesine karşı para vakıfları ile bu kurumların işlevlerini yerine getirmesi, Osmanlı iktisadi ve finansal zihniyetini anlamak açısından önemlidir. Bu çalışmanın amacı birincil kaynaklarından incelenen para vakıfları ile Osmanlı iktisadi zihniyetini analiz etmektir. Ayrıca aynı dönemde faaliyet gösteren ve para vakıfları ile çağdaş olarak Avrupa’da faaliyet gösteren finansal kurumlar da incelenecek ve iktisadi zihniyetler arasında karşılaştırma yapılmaya çalışılacaktır.
N25|Economic philosophy of al-Mawardi: Review of economic behaviour in Islamic economic|Economic behaviour in the study of Islamic economics is the basis for the government to portray political ethics and ethical economic functions of individuals in functioning as a member of society. Secular ethics and religious ethics, according to al-Mawardi, as the code of conduct in conducting economic practices by the government and every member of society to uphold the principle of goodness. In the context of economic behaviour, the world ethics (adab al-dunya) and the religious ethics (adab al-din) became guidelines for economic actors in conducting business activities including other forms of cooperation or other muamalah practice.
N25|Stock market reactions to wars and political risks: A cliometric perspective for a falling empire|In this paper, based on cliometric methodology we use new historical data on the most popular stocks traded at the İstanbul bourse between 1910 and 1914, to examine the effect of wars on stock market prices. During this period, the Ottoman Empire was involved in the Turco-Italian and the Balkan wars, leading to massive land losses and risks for the companies before the First World War. The data are manually collected from the available volumes of a daily Ottoman newspaper, Tanin. Our findings are surprising, as we observe only a temporary and small drop in stock prices, indicating little perceived risk by stock investors of the İstanbul bourse.
N25|Market Discipline and Bank Risk Taking: Evidence from the East Asian Banking Sector|The third pillar of the Basel II highlights the role of market discipline in easing the existing pressure on traditional monitoring measures like capital requirement and government supervision. This study test the effectiveness of market discipline in inducing prudential risk management practices among the East Asian banks over the 1995 to 2005 period. Market discipline is measured using information disclosure and interbank deposit holdings. We find that only the latter is an effective market discipline tool. However, the former becomes effective when market concentration is higher. We find that government owned, foreign owned and recapilatised banks are subject to market disciplining when disclosure in taken account but the opposite is true when interbank deposits is taken into account. Finally, we find that banks that disclose more risk related information hold more capital against their non-performing loan. The implications of the findings are discussed.

During this period, the Ottoman Empire was involved in the Turco-Italian and the Balkan wars, leading to massive land losses before the First World War. The data are manually collected from the available volumes of two daily Ottoman newspapers, Tercüman-ı Hakikat and Tanin. Our findings are quite surprising, as we observe only a temporary and small drop of prices, indicating little perceived risk by stock investors of the Istanbul bourse.
N25|Do Corporate Governance Practices In One Jurisdiction Affect Another One? Lessons from the Panama Papers|To what extent do corporate governance practices in one jurisdiction affect another? In this paper, we look at the way that Hong Kong’s and the Mainland’s corporate governance practices have co-evolved, along with offshore incorporations from both places. Drawing on empirical illustrations of the data using analytical techniques like differential equations and Fourier Spectral Analysis, we find a strong relationship across time between changes in corporate governance practices in both jurisdictions as well as offshore incorporations. Our data also support the idea of a theory-free equilibrium level of corporate governance (determined by market participants’ own behaviour rather than by a theory-laden econometric model). We show that lethargy likely explains the persistence of corporate governance practices in both places, with innovations in one place correlating with innovations in the other. Such work clearly implies that corporate governance improvements in one place can help encourage such improvements in other markets which have not adopted laws aimed at improving corporate governance.
N25|Desarrollo de la Banca Islámica. El Caso de Indonesia. Contexto y evolución|En las últimas décadas ha tenido lugar un importante desarrollo de la banca islámica y de las finanzas islámicas en general. En países como Malasia, Arabia Saudí o Bangladesh ésta ha experimentado una expansión significativa frente a la banca convencional. En Indonesia, el país con la mayor población musulmana del mundo, el desarrollo de la banca islámica está siendo más tardío. El análisis de su nacimiento e impulso pone de manifiesto las ventajas y desafíos del sector. Su peso es aún relativamente reducido pero el avance del sector financiero islámico, con un mayor impulso del mercado de capitales islámico siguiendo el ejemplo de Malasia, podría ser un factor positivo para una mejor canalización del ahorro hacia la inversión productiva en el país. En cualquier caso es conveniente que se produzcan mejoras en términos de eficiencia en el sector bancario en general y en la banca islámica en particular.
N25|Colonial adventures in tropical agriculture: new estimates of returns to investment in the Netherlands Indies, 1919–1938|How profitable were foreign investments in plantation agriculture in the Netherlands Indies during the late colonial era? We use a new dataset of monthly quoted stock prices and dividends of international companies at the Brussels stock exchange to estimate the returns to investment in tropical agriculture (1919–1938). We adopt the Dimson–March–Staunton method to compute real geometric annual average rates of return and assess our estimates in an international comparative perspective. We find that returns to colonial FDI in the Netherlands Indies during 1919–1928 were impressive (14.3 %), being almost 3 percentage points higher than the world average. In the following decade 1929–1938 fortunes reversed, with a rate of return of −2.8 % compared to a world average of 2.2 %. Over the entire period the returns to colonial FDI (5.4 % in 1919–1938) were about a factor 2.5 higher than returns to investment in the Dutch domestic economy (2.1 % in 1920–1939). We argue that these returns should be interpreted in a colonial context of systematic labour repression, but that they may also partly reflect a higher risk-premium of investments in colonial commodities.
N25|How Japan remained on the Gold Standard despite unsustainable external debt|In the period of the classic gold standard, most peripheral countries were frequently affected by so-called sudden stops as well as by financial and currency crises. Yet pre-War Japan was an outlier. Though its level of external debt was not sustainable, Japan issued many government foreign loans to cover its current account deficits, was never affected by currency crises, and was never forced to suspend convertibility. We argue that, from the late nineteenth century until just before World War I, Japan and Britain engaged in a politico-economic exchange: Japan offered to protect Britain's economic and political interests in the Far East provided that Britain gave the rising Asian power access to financial markets—namely, in the City of London.
N25|Stock market efficiency in China: Evidence from the split-share reform|We perform an event study to investigate the efficiency of the Chinese stock market. We study the reaction of stock returns and trading volumes to the 2005–2006 structural reform which allowed the transformation of non-tradable shares (NTS) into tradable shares (TS) through payment of a compensation to holders of TS. We find evidence of positive abnormal returns in the few days before announcement of which companies will undergo the reform process, that can be explained by information leakage and not by a compensation risk premium, and in the ten days after the readmission to trading of participating companies following the determination of the compensation, which is consistent with a Merton visibility effect. We use a bootstrap procedure designed to replicate the actual degree of covariance across firms.

N25|The Influence of USD/CNY Foreign Exchange Rate, RMB NEER and Spatial Effects on China’s Foreign Trade|Purpose - This paper analyzes the influence of different forms of RMB foreign exchange rates on Chinese foreign trade. Design/methodology/approach - This paper constructed Spatial Panel model and MCMC estimation method and collected the data of 25 countries’ (including China) quarterly macroeconomic data from first quarter of 1993 until third quarter of 2013 to conduct the data analysis. Findings - This paper finds that USD/CNY, which is widely used in trade settlement, is more significant in effecting Chinese export.1% appreciation of CNY against USD will lead to 1.532% decline of Chinese export, while 1% appreciation of CNY NEER only 0.42%. What’s more, 1% increases of the volatility of USD/CNY results in 0.579% decline of Chinese export. As policy suggestions, we should further reform the foreign exchange derivative market in China, and provide more currency derivatives, so that the ability of Chinese economy to deal with foreign exchange risk could be improved. Research limitations/implications - Effect of exchange rate on imports and exports relates to the future direction of China's exchange rate policy. This paper claims that China should accelerate the construction of foreign exchange derivatives market, improving the ability to respond quickly to foreign currency risk - Practical implications First, denominated exchange rate has more significant impact on the Chinese export trade to other countries than effective exchange rate. - Second, the RMB exchange rate fluctuations also significantly affect the export trade. Third, China's import and export trade have significant spatial effect. - Originality/value This article uses Spatial Panel Model with the refined data to study various factors on the import and export trade, and thus more comprehensive analysis on the impact of the exchange rate on the import and export trade with other major countries.
N25|Ethical strategy focus and mutual fund management: performance and persistence|Over the last few years academics and practitioners alike have been analyzing the relative performance of different types of mutual funds, with a particular emphasis on comparing the performance of conventional versus socially responsible investment (SRI). The methods and samples used, as well as the results obtained are diverse, but they generally point to the difficulties found by SRI to yield an equivalent performance as that of its conventional peers—given the investment constraints they face. In this study we focus on the comparative performance of a sample of SRI funds, which we decompose mainly into Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), environmental, and religious, and which invest in three different geographical areas. For these funds we measure not only performance but, more importantly, their persistence—i.e., whether the best (worst) funds are past winners (losers) as well. This twofold objective turns out to be essential to uncover some trends in the industry. Specifically, whereas ESG, in general, outperform their environmental peers, a deeper scrutiny focusing also on performance persistence reveals that this claim should be tempered, since investing in the best past environmental funds yields superior performance than investing in the best past ESG funds. This result, which holds for the two main geographical regions analyzed (Europe and US/Canada), would indicate that the comparison between these two types of funds is more intricate than what we might a priori expect, being particularly relevant to factor in the comparison an evaluation of performance persistence.
N25|Excess capital and bank behavior : evidence from Indonesia|The Indonesian banking sector has been restructured since Asian financial crisis and restored to soundness. The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) returned to a sound level; however, the average excess capital has become too high, while credit disbursement has remained low. This paper investigates the determinants of excess capital among Indonesian banks and its effects on credit growth during the 2000s. The results indicate that the determinants of excess capital vary widely depending on bank type. Return on equity (ROE) affects excess capital negatively among domestic banks, and the effect of non-performing loans is mixed, differing for various bank types. Excess capital affects credit growth positively, except among foreign banks.
N25|Japanese responses to asset price bubbles: comparison with the U.S|It is widely believed that the Japanese response to the boom and the bust in the late 1980s and early 1990s was too little and too late, while that of the US in the 2000 was decisive and timely. Though such may have been the case with the bailing out of large banks and the recognition and resolution of bad assets, the monetary policy responses in Japan and the U.S. before and after the real estate price peaks closely resemble each other in their i) size and timing of tightening and easing, ii) deviation from the Taylor targets and iii) responses to asset price impulse. Prudential policies in Japan and the US also were common in that they i) started with qualitative guidance on real estate lending in the early phases of the bubble, ii) added layers of qualitative guidance as the bubble grew, and iii) stepped into quantitative guidance only after the initial signs of peaking-out. Though the Japanese authorities are believed to have gleaned h to prick the bubble while the U.S. authorities argued against leaning and advocated gcleaning up h the mess after the bust, their behavior did not differ much. Intention, action and effects staggered with each other and both monetary and prudential policies in Japan and in the U.S. lagged behind the real estate price moves and may have deepened the bust. Timeliness of the policy responses may matter more than how they are motivated, explained or labelled: clean or lean, microor macro-prudential.
N25|Silver points, silver flows, and the measure of Chinese financial integration|To what degree were Chinese financial markets integrated with the rest of the world prior to the 1949 Revolution and to what extent was the Chinese foreign exchange market efficient during this period? We estimate silver points for the Shanghai market from 1905 to 1933 to answer these questions. Our inferred measures are small in value, favorably match measured costs of the silver trade derived from contemporary accounts, and fare well in the comparison to estimates of trans-Atlantic gold points. This leads to the conclusion that the degree of Chinese financial market integration was substantial. However, during and immediately after World War I, our estimates of the silver points increased appreciably, foreshadowing the collapse of China's linkages to world financial markets beginning in the 1930s.
N25|Japan's ultimately unaccursed natural resources-financed industrialization|Japan's successful industrialization in the late 19th and early 20th century largely exhausted its then abundant natural resources. Rather than exemplifying rapid development in the absence of natural resources, Japan shows how laissez-faire government and successfully transplanted classical liberal institutions, including active stock markets, exorcised a natural resources curse that undermined its prior state-led industrialization strategy. Japan's post-WWII reconstruction relied little on natural resources and more on bank financing and state direction, but was not an example of an initial industrialization.

N25|Finansal İstikrar ve Para Vakıfları Etkisi: Rumeli Para Vakıfları Örnekleri<BR>[Financial Stability and Cash Waqfs: Samples of Rumelia Cash Waqfs]|Vakıflar, İslam toplumlarında yardımlaşmanın ve toplumsal dayanışmanın yanında sosyal ve ekonomik hayatın önemli unsurları olarak karşımıza çıkmaktadır. Vakıfların en önemli özelliği bu yardımlaşma ve dayanışmayı kurumsal hale getirmeleridir. Osmanlı Devleti’nde toplumsal hayatta çok önemli bir yer tutan vakıflar, Osmanlı Devleti’nin bir vakıf medeniyeti olarak anılmasına vesile olmuştur. Yapılan akademik çalışmalar ve analizler de vakıfların ekonomik sistemde merkez hazinesi ve tımar sisteminin hemen arkasında üçüncü bir ekonomik kurum olarak ortaya çıktığını göstermektedir. Bu sebeple, Osmanlı ekonomik yapısı üzerine yapılacak çalışmalarda vakıfların rolünü incelemek de oldukça önemlidir. Bu vakıfların bir türü “para (nukud) vakıfları” bu çalışmanın konusunu oluşturacaktır. Birincil kaynaklardan incelenen vakfiyeler üzerinden para vakıfların kuruluşları ve dayandıkları İslami arka plan incelenecektir. Ayrıca bu vakıfların uyguladıkları kâr oranlarının uzun dönemli analizi üzerinde durulacaktır. Aynı dönemlerde Avrupa’da uygulanan faiz oranları ile Osmanlı para vakıflarının kâr oranlarının karşılaştırması yapılacaktır. Bölge olarak Rumeli’nin seçilmesi de bu bölge hakkında para vakıfları hakkında yeterli derecede çalışma olmamasından ötürüdür. We meet waqf not only institutions provided the assistance and social solidarity between people but also an important elements of social and economic life in Islamic societies. The most important feature of waqf is to make this cooperation and solidarity institutional. The waqfs that had a very important place in social life in the Ottoman State have been instrumental that Ottoman State is a civilization of waqfs. Academic studies and analysis also shows that waqf system was third place in economic institutions after central treasury and timar system in economic system (Özcan, 2008, p. 143). Therefore, it is important to examine the role of waqf in studies on Ottoman economic structure. One type of this waqfs, “cash waqfs” will be subject of this study. The establishment procedure of cash waqfs and Islamic background of cash waqfs will be examined from primary sources (waqfiyahs). Moreover, we will emphasized long-term analysis on the profit rates that were determined by cash waqfs. The comparison between the European interest rates and profit rates of Ottoman cash waqfs at same era will be made. The region of Rumelia is selected as subject because there are not enough works about cash waqfs in this region.
N25|A Comparison between Ottoman Cash Waqfs (CWs) and Participation Banks and Modern Interest-free Financial Institutions|The Ottoman State is accepted as the civilization of waqf so that the borrowing of people who needed cash was provided by waqfs that had cash as capital. These waqfs operated their capitals within the limits that were drawn by Ottoman ulema under the effects of interest ban in Islamic states. These waqfs can be thought of as the pioneers of modern Islamic financial institutions. The CWs became the factor of stability in the Ottoman financial system with controlling high usury rates and determining the market interest rate. Today, the participation banks as interest-free financial institutions fulfill this function. The participation banks that bring together the people who want to borrow money without interest and the people who want to operate his capital with halal ways are separated from cash waqfs in some respects. In this study, even though they follow similar financial methods, the difference in their purposes and other characteristics of interest-free financial institutions and their pioneer of CWs will be examined.
N25|Markup and efficiency of Indian banks: an input distance function approach|Abstract This paper examines market power and efficiency in Indian banking using a unified theoretical framework based on the primal approach. Empirical results show that due to high level of concentration, large banks hold the capacity to impose higher prices, particularly on advances, and enjoy significant market power. Indian banks, particularly Indian private and foreign banks, are operating below their efficient scale and cost savings can be obtained by increasing their size of operations. The impact of financial deregulation led to a decline in average markup of banks initially, but this trend got reversed in 2002. The increasing trend of market power is mostly determined by bank size. Large banks enjoy greater market power due to either cost advantages or to their capacity to impose higher prices. Lower marginal cost and higher return of the so-called efficient structure have helped the large banks to maintain higher efficiency level. Finally, higher market power was also reflected in higher profit.
N25|The role of financial elites in banking supervision in Japan from 1927 to 1998|"Following the collapse of the bubble economy in Japan, banking supervisors and bank examiners were severely criticized by the media as human capital had long been viewed the key element of Japanese banking supervision. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the bank supervisors´ career paths over the long term, including ""amakudari"" appointments from among the Directors of the Financial Inspection Department of the Ministry of Finance, and the Director-Generals of the Bank Examination Department of the Bank of Japan. The paper analyzes the performance of several regional banks that accepted the appointment of an ex-Director or an ex-Director-General as their president in order to examine whether such an amakudari relationship worsened such banks´ management. The majority of ex-Directors and ex-Director-Generals entered a regional bank or a regional bank II, many of which were already experiencing problems. Regarding the regional banks, lower growth rates of loans were observed in all cases, and lower loan/deposit ratios or higher capital/asset ratios were observed in most. These findings suggest that the link between the amakudari relationship and the bubble economy in the late 1980s was not as straightforwardly negative as is generally considered."
N25|The Role of Hong Kong’s Financial Regulations in Improving Corporate Governance Standards in China: Lessons from the Panama Papers for Hong Kong|Hong Kong contributes to poor corporate governance on the Mainland. Could regulatory reform in Hong Kong help improve corporate governance standards/practices (and thus firm value) on the Mainland? In this paper, we discuss ways to incentivize Mainland firms to improve their corporate governance by adopting numerous market-value increasing reforms in Hong Kong. These include the limited extra-territorial application of corporate governance provisions, changes to the Listing Rules to ‘contract’ for better corporate governance, and incentives to collect better corporate governance data. Other reforms include increasing financial transparency (particularly about corporate ownership and control), reducing financial firms’ incentives to trade in shell corporations, regulating relationships with tax havens, and encouraging the redrafting of China’s 2002 Code of Corporate Governance. We provide 31 recommendations and estimate that these recommendations can increase market values on the Mainland by 7% (or in value of roughly $330 billion), while improving the value-added of Hong Kong’s own incorporation/corporate services companies.
N25|The Value of the Corporate Governance Canon on Chinese Companies|China has yet to import the corporate governance “canon” (generally accepted rules as promoting share holder value as well as minority shareholder and other stakeholders’ rights) into its Code of Corporate Governance. What effect would Chinese companies’ simply adopting such a canon – as defined by Hong Kong or other foreign corporate governance practices -- have on their share prices? We look at Mainland Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, looking at the way their share prices react to economic fluctuations when they have better or worse corporate governance practices. Using a differences-of-differences methodology, that such share prices could/would increase by around 7% -- increasing profits by about $330 billion. Yet, a significant part of the distribution of these companies loose money in the short-run. These results provide yet another confirmation that adopting the corporate governance canon can profit companies’ investors, but not all of them.
N25|Hard Corporate Governance Law in a Soft Law Jurisdiction|China’s fuzzy corporate governance rules (whether hard or soft) do not help company managers, government officials and others coordinate and cooperate – the raison d’etre for corporate governance rules. In a corporate system dominated by personal relationships and rules, clarity and specificity – even in principles-based corporate governance – serve Chinese corporations far better than passing rules into law or visa versa. We show how existing rules (whether soft, lard, mandatory, voluntary, etc.) harm corporate interests. We illustrate how adding clarity makes the hard/soft law distinction moot. “Coordinatable” rules which help new Chinese participants in corporate governance understand government expectations, follow these understandings, and seek recourse through existing mechanisms, will serve Chinese companies better than best practice or rules of thumb like having a certain proportion of independent directors, internal auditors, etc.
N25|War-related risks and the Ýstanbul bourse on the eve of the First World War|The lack of well-documented information in the historical literature on the relationship between war-related expectations and their effects on the bond market in the Ottoman Empire motivates this paper's three contributions. First, this paper is the first empirical study to investigate the break points in the volatility of Ottoman bond prices from a historical point of view. Second, we use the econometric technique developed by Inclan and Tiao (1994) to identify the structural breaks. Last, we use a manually collected dataset from the daily newspapers of the time on daily Ottoman bond prices from 1910 to 1914. Subsequently, we identify five structural break dates, each of them corresponding to important war-related events. When we investigate the commentaries in the Ottoman newspapers, we see that the outbreak of several wars might not have been a surprise for investors in the Ottoman Empire, as reflected by government bond prices.
N25|Indonesian Macro Policy through Two Crises|Indonesia’s open, developing economy fielded shocks due to the Asian financial crisis (AFC) and the global financial crisis (GFC) quite differently. Although the origins of both crises were external, during the AFC the coincidence of financial contagion with domestic political upheaval saw the Indonesian economy collapse. By contrast, during the decade-later GFC, when most nations slumped into recession the Indonesian economy slowed but did not recess, achieving real growth of 6.1% (2008) and 4.5% (2009) and recording one of the world’s best performances for the period. This paper reviews these events and employs numerical modelling of stylized AFC and GFC shocks to show that some of the contrast stems from differences in the states of the global economy during the crises and the compositions of the external shocks in each case. This said, both shocks have capital flight elements and it is shown that the key policy responses include floating the exchange rate and fiscal expansions that are, where necessary, money financed. There is, nonetheless, evidence of evolution in Indonesian macroeconomic policy making between the crises that allowed its strong performance to be sustained.
N25|Twentieth century enterprise forms: Japan in comparative perspective|La Porta et al see Anglo-American common law as most favourable to economic development, but in 1899 Japan explicitly preferred the German corporate law tradition. Yet its new Commercial Code omitted the GmbH (private company) form, which Guinnane et al see as the jewel in the crown of Germany’s organizational menu. Neither apparent “mistake” retarded Japan’s business development because its corporate laws offered flexible governance and liability options, implemented liberally. Surprisingly (given that Germany’s organizational menu predated Japan’s by many decades and the country was wealthier), by the 1930s Japanese businesses already used not only corporations proper (kabushiki kaisha) but also commandite partnerships (goshi kaisha, with more corporate characteristics than Anglo-American partnerships) more intensively than Germany. After the introduction of the yugen kaisha (a GmbH-equivalent) in 1940, corporate forms were nearly as widely used in Japan as in the US, the UK or Switzerland.
N25|Bad Investments and Missed Opportunities? Postwar Capital Flows to Asia and Latin America|After World War II, international capital flowed into slow-growing Latin America rather than fast-growing Asia. This is surprising as, everything else equal, fast growth should imply high capital returns. This paper develops a capital flow accounting framework to quantify the role of different factor market distortions in producing these patterns. Surprisingly, we find that distortions in labor markets, rather than domestic or international capital markets, account for the bulk of these flows. Labor market distortions that indirectly depress investment incentives by lowering equilibrium labor supply explain two-thirds of observed flows, while improvement in these distortions over time accounts for much of Asia's rapid growth.
N25|Financing Asia’s Growth|Recent key challenges highlight the need to revisit Asia’s financial development. These include the region’s growth slowdown since the global crisis, compounded by a less benign external environment; internal structural challenges, such as population aging; and the maturing of much of the region into middle-income status. The evolving shift in the region’s growth paradigm from one based primarily on investment to one based on both investment and productivity growth also underscores the urgency for financial development. For economic growth to benefit more from a sound and efficient financial system, financial development should be complemented with structural and policy reforms in other areas. This means that financial development and inclusion work best in a policy environment that is conducive to growth and development.
N25|Factors of Competitiveness of Islamic Banks in the New Financial Order|This paper studies the factor of competitive conditions of conventional and Islamic banks operating in the same market in the MENA region. We determine the level of competitiveness between the two types of banks by using the PR-H statistic of Panzar and Ross (1987) and the Lerner index. Our estimations show that banking sectors in MENA operate under monopolistic competition. Our results confirm that Islamic banks are significantly more competitive than conventional banks and they express a higher degree of market power. We show also that profitability significantly increases with market power, but this does not warrant higher profitability levels for Islamic banks.
N25|Tunneling or Not? The Change of Legal Environment on the Effect of Post-Privatization Performance|Motivated by Hoff and Stiglitz’s (Am Econ Rev 94(3):753–763, 2004 ) theory, we examine empirically how the creation of “rules of the game” affect the behavior of economic agents in a transition economy. Using a sample of Chinese state-owned enterprises in which controlling ownership was transferred to private acquirers between 1994 and 2006, we find that the post-privatization performance (PPP) of firms depends on institutional factors. Before 2003, we observe severe post-privatization tunneling behaviors by acquirers and worse PPP. However, from 2003, when the State issued regulations against tunneling and strengthened enforcement, the incidence of tunneling behaviors declined, and PPP improved. We find that better implementation of ownership transfer and longer prior experience of private acquirers are key factors that contribute to the improvement.

N25|Property Rights Protection in 18th century Japan Revisited; the Case of Rice Backed Security Exchange Market|If market economy are to work, they need institutions of economic governance. In traditional economics, there seems universal agreement that the framework of contract law provided by the government is a necessary condition for a market economy to work. Recently, the complementary relationship between the law and private ordering come under the spotlight. This paper investigates the process of this complementary relationship emerged in early modern Japan where the Shogunate had absolute power. Until the begging of 18th century, the market order was supported by private ordering. In mid 18th century the Shogunate have began to protect rice merchants' property rights in spited the fact that it had never been forced to do. This process provides us with a good case example to consider the nature of the economic governance.
N25|Capital Markets in China and Britain, 18th and 19th Century: Evidence from Grain Prices|Based on the most comprehensive grain prices available, we employ an asset-­- pricing model to estimate consistent interest rates and compare capital market development in Britain and China. Estimated interest rates for Britain were at least 28% lower than for China from 1770 to 1860. Regional capital market integration in the Yangzi Delta comes close to the British Average at distances below 200 kilometers, but at larger distances interest rate correlations in Britain are twice those of the Delta, and three or more times as high as elsewhere in China. Overall, our results suggest capital market divergence at an early date.
N25|The Politics of Industry in Nehru's India|The paper argues that the Indian Managing Agencies that controlled most industrial firms and their associated enterprises were themselves embodiments of pre-industrial forms of capital, accumulated through trading and moneylending. This militated against technological dynamism within the industrial firms because the managing agencies applied a profit maximising calculus across their various business activities, rather than in relationship to any individual firm. The group structure, in fact, facilitated the leakage of surpluses generated in industrial activity into the parallel speculative and money lending interests of the Managing Agents. After independence, the Government’s attempts to reform the industrial sector met resistance from politically influential businessmen who had supported the national anti-colonial movement. The British Government also interceded here. The social engineering that these reforms entailed, embodied in legislation, was thwarted by the combined pressures exerted by affected businessmen, but this should not prevent an appreciation of what the state was attempting.
N25|Not a Coincidence: Sons-in-Law as Successors in Successful Japanese Family Firms|Vikas Mehrotra, Randall Morck, Jungwook Shim and Yupana Wiwattanakantang (2013; hereafter MMSW) observe that listed family firms on average outperform non-family firms in Japan between 1962- 2000. They suggest that this finding can be explained by the practice of adult adoptions and, to a lesser degree, by arranged marriages. Their argument centers on a positive performance differential between non-blood and blood heirs. We cannot exactly replicate MMSW's research, because the authors do not share their data. However, we identify methodological concerns with the evidencing of this differential and show how conceptual considerations reduce their argument to that of arranged marriages. Regardless of any differential we propose another interpretation for the superior performance of businesses run by non-blood heirs and identify indicative evidence for this.

N25|Dynamic Depositor Discipline: Evidence Based on East Asian Banks|This study confirms the endogenous relationship between the price and quantity of deposits in the depositor discipline model. Dynamic panel data analysis is carried out to account for the lagged dependency of the deposits growth variable and endogeneity of the price mechanism in the depositor discipline model. The results show that depositors in East Asia do not demand a higher price for deposits. Analysis by subdividing the sample of banks into healthy and weak banks shows that the relationship between price and quantity is not non-linear. Healthy banks are not able to attract more deposits by raising price. Depositors do not discipline weak banks by demanding a higher return. Lack of responsiveness by depositors to price signals may be attributable largely to the outflow of deposits that happened during the crisis period and regulations on interest rates.

N25|What makes banking crisis resolution difficult? Lessons from Japan and the Nordic Countries|Banking crisis resolution is often a long-lasting process with large fiscal and social costs. We ask which difficulties authorities face when choosing and implementing resolution packages. We survey the literature analyzing the impact of single resolution instruments on moral hazard and fiscal costs. We argue that no best-practice resolution package exists and that the implementation of a package is subject to coordination failures. Since crisis resolution packages are country-specific, we follow a case-study approach and describe how regulators in Japan and the Nordic countries during the 1990s solved their financial crises. We identify several obstacles the authorities in these countries were faced with and analyse their crisis resolution in the context of moral hazard and fiscal costs. Finally, we use these lessons to reassess the policy reactions in the US and in Europe during the recent financial crisis. Copyright Eurasia Business and Economics Society 2015
N25|Sovereign debt guarantees and default: Lessons from the UK and Ireland, 1920–1938|We study the daily yields on Irish land bonds listed on the Dublin Stock Exchange during the years 1920–1938. We exploit Irish events during the period and structural differences in land bonds to tease out a measure of investors׳ credibility in a UK sovereign guarantee. Using Ireland׳s default on intergovernmental payments in 1932, we find a premium of about 43 basis points associated with uncertainty about the UK government guarantee. We discuss the economic and political forces behind the Irish and UK governments׳ decisions pertaining to the default. Our finding has implications for modern-day proposals to issue jointly-guaranteed sovereign debt.
N25|Indonesian Macro Policy through Two Crises|Indonesia fielded shocks due to the Asian financial crisis (AFC) and the global financial crisis (GFC) quite differently. Financial contagion, policy misdirection, panic and political upheaval saw the AFC bring economic collapse. The decade-later GFC, however, brought real growth of 6.1% (2008) and 4.5% (2009), amongst the world’s best performances at the time. This paper reviews these events and employs numerical modelling of stylized AFC and GFC shocks to show that some of the contrast stems from differences in the shocks and intervening changes in economic structure. Critically, IMF conditionality during the AFC required unsustainably contractionary reforms. Capital flight elements were present in both crises, however, and exchange rate depreciations and money-financed fiscal expansions are shown to have contributed significantly to resolution.

N25|Capital Inflows, Exchange Rate Flexibility and Credit Booms| Historically, capital flow bonanzas have often fueled sharp credit expansions in advanced and emerging market economies alike. Focusing primarily on emerging markets, this paper analyzes the impact of exchange rate flexibility on credit markets during periods of large capital inflows. It is shown that bank credit is larger and its composition tilts to foreign currency in economies with less flexible exchange rate regimes, and that these results are not explained entirely by the fact that the latter attract more capital inflows than economies with more flexible regimes. The findings thus suggest countries with less flexible exchange rate regimes may stand to benefit the most from regulatory policies that reduce banks' incentives to tap external markets and to lend/borrow in foreign currency; these policies include marginal reserve requirements on foreign lending, currency-dependent liquidity requirements and higher capital requirement and/or dynamic provisioning on foreign exchange loans.
N25|From Hierarchy to Market: the Changing Industrial Organization of Epistemic Communities During Hong Kongs Transition to a Cashless Society (1965-2005)|This paper documents how computer technology modified retail financial markets in Hong Kong in the period from the 1960s to the early 2000s. The forty years after the deployment of Hong KongÕs first computer in 1965, saw a dramatic change in retail banking technology as Hong Kong moved towards being a cashless society. Prior to that pivotal year, none of the colonyÕs banks used computers whilst retail customers accessed their liquid balances via cash and cheques and only during banking hours. Over time, the ways in which people spent money became more diverse and transformed with the advent of technologies such as the ATM, point of purchase debit card terminals, the Octopus chip, and mobile phone payments. One could construct a straightforward narrative arc that links the acquisition of HSBCÕs first computer in 1967 to the proliferation of electronic payment systems in the twenty-first century. Such a narrative, however, would obscure an important discontinuity in the history of retail payment technology. In the early stages of Hong KongÕs transition to the cashless society, the relevant technologies were installed and managed within the boundaries of large financial intuitions such as HSBC. The second episode discussed in this paper is the successful launch of a micro-payments solution called ÒOctopusÓ. Initially designed as a transport payments card, cash balances stored within a smart chip grew outside financial institutions to become the leading payment solution in small value transactions. Over the course of the period covered by this article, the industrial organization of the relevant technologies transformed as the provision of much of the technology for retail payments had been outsourced to non-bank, non-financial institutions. In other words, the industrial organization of the relevant technologies had been transformed. This paper seeks to account for this shift in the organization of payments technology by drawing on literature around the boundaries of the firm as well as the theory of the firm as an epistemic community. It will be suggested that this process of vertical disintegration (i.e., a shift from hierarchy to markets) took place because of changes in the underlying conditions in Hong KongÕs economy.
N25|‘Unfinished business’: Historic complementarities, political competition and ethnic violence in Gujarat|I examine how the historical legacies of inter-ethnic complementarity and competition interact with contemporary electoral competition in shaping patterns of ethnic violence. Using local comparisons within Gujarat, a single Indian state known for both its non-violent local traditions and for widespread ethnic pogroms in 2002, I provide evidence that where political competition was focused upon towns where ethnic groups have historically competed, there was a rise in the propensity for ethnic rioting and increased electoral support for the incumbent party complicit in the violence. However, where political competition was focused in towns that historically enjoyed inter-ethnic complementarities, there were fewer ethnic riots, and these towns also voted against the incumbent. These historic legacies proved to be important predictors of the identity of the winner even in very close electoral races. I argue that these results reflect the role local inter-ethnic economic relations can play in altering the nature and the benefits of political campaigns that encourage ethnic violence.

N25|Interest rate pass-through and monetary policy asymmetry: A journey into the Caucasian black box|This paper analyses the interest rate pass-through for five economies of the Caucasus – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Russia. Employing an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) specification to monthly data, we find that the interest rate pass-through is systematically incomplete and sluggish, probably due to macroeconomic instability and a low degree of competition in the banking sector. It is not clear whether pass-through has improved over time and asymmetric adjustment is found to characterize the pass-through only occasionally. Overall, our results show a considerable degree of cross-country heterogeneity in the pass-through.
N25|How should we bank with foreigners? An empirical assessment of lending behavior of international banks to six East Asian economies|We construct macro-and micro-panel data on international bank lending to six Asian economies—Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand—over the period 2000 to 2010 to analyze a number of objectives. The paper first examines the critical determinants not only to overall international bank lending but also to cross-border bank lending, and find that cross-border lending by international banks tend to pull out from host economies during difficult times in source economies, whereas such retrenchments are not evident on the basis of overall lending. The paper next examines the differences between subsidiaries and branches of international banks in their ability to shield themselves from the financial difficulties of their global parent banks and thus their ability to continue lending in destination markets. The results show that foreign bank subsidiaries are more capable in this regard.

An Empirical Assessment of Lending Behaviour of International Banks to Six East Asian Economies| The possible crucial role of international bank lending in the transmission of adverse economic disturbance from advanced economies to emerging economies in the recent global financial crisis has once again placed this type of capital flows into sharper scrutiny both in academic and policy discussions. We construct macro-and micro-panel data on international bank lending to six Asian economies, viz., Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, to analyse a number of objectives. We first examine the influence of a number of critical determinants not only to overall international bank lending but also to cross-border bank lending, and obtained one critical finding in this part of the study that cross-border lending by international banks tend to pull-out from host economies during difficult times in source economies, whereas such retrenchments are not evident on an aggregated basis.
N25|The political economy of Byzantium: transaction costs and the decentralisation of the Byzantine Empire in the twelfth century|This thesis aims to contribute to an explanation of how the development of political institutions is influenced by the costs of information and exchange across society in a pre-modern context. The Byzantine Empire in the twelfth century presents an apparent paradox of an expanding economy alongside a weakening central state. Application of a dynamic transaction-cost framework can illustrate how political and economic decentralisation can rationally occur as non-state actors begin to gain a comparative transaction-cost advantage over the state. Geopolitical and economic developments of the late-eleventh and twelfth century empowered non-state provincial interests in the Byzantine Empire to the detriment of the central state apparatus, including the imperial bureaucracy. Economic growth, an increasingly fluid provincial political environment, and the decline of the imperial navy simultaneously raised the transaction costs of the state and lowered the transaction costs of local interests. This shift prompted the decentralisation of power that ultimately contributed to the destruction of the Byzantine state in 1204. The state faced increasing relative costs of information acquisition, security provision, and tax collection as provincial transaction costs declined and state networks were allowed to degrade. Decentralisation of political and economic power became first possible, then practical, and finally unavoidable in a process that fatally undermined the cohesion of the empire. This thesis uses a transaction cost framework to provide an economically informed explanation of political decline that complements the traditional politically focused narrative and begins to address the contradiction apparent in a state ruling over increasingly prosperous territory, yet proving so fragile by the closing years of the twelfth century.
N25|L’impact d’une transaction asynchrone sur la prévisibilité des rendements : cas du marché coréen|L’objectif de ce papier est d’étudier l’impact d’une transaction asynchrone sur la prévisibilité des rendements de deux indices de différentes liquidités du marché Coréen. Nous proposons une nouvelle alternative qui se focalise sur l’étude de l’effet lead-lag sur la valeur de deux indices de chaque marché étudié en adoptant la méthodologie de Camilleri et Green [2004] sur le marché Coréen. Les résultats obtenus montrent que l’indice le plus liquide devance (lead) l’indice moins liquide surtout dans le cas des données à haute fréquence. La prévisibilité des rendements est attribuée à une transaction asynchrone et non à un retard des ajustements des prix à une nouvelle information.
N25|Is Ethical Money Sensitive to Past Returns? The Case of Portfolio Constraints and Persistence of Islamic and Socially Responsible Funds|We analyse the performance persistence and survivorship bias of Islamic and Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) funds. The remarkable growth of these two types of ethical funds over the last two decades raises the question of how non-financial attributes influence performance and performance persistence. We propose a refined version of the procedures used in the literature based on a cross-sectional test to control for significance of the recursive portfolios according to past performance. This procedure allows us to correctly identify whether this abnormal performance is due to a dynamic investment strategy based on past performance, or whether it is obtained by simply investing in a particular set of mutual funds. The analysis shows that Islamic funds were particularly resilient during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Regarding persistence, its significance varies depending on the time horizon (yearly/half-yearly), survivorship, or tail of the distribution. According to the type of fund we find that, in the case of Islamic funds, persistence only exists for the best funds. However, for SRI funds, evidence is weaker and persistence only exists for the worst funds.
N25|Macroeconomic Policy with Financial Market Stability: A Case Study of the Early 19th Century in Japan|This paper provides a historical case study in pre-modern era which shows that financial market stability is a necessary condition for an effective macroeconomic policy. We explore the implications on the rice market interventions as a tool of the macroeconomic policy in Japan's early 19th century. Some anecdotal evidences support the view that, in the wake of the policy failure in 1761, the Shogunate recognized the importance of the financial market stability as well as the rice price stability in implementing the market interventions. By using high-frequency event study approach, we find that, while the 'actual' interventions before October 1806 did not help the rice market to boost up, the Shogunate was successful to improve the rice exchange market by the 'oral' interventions after October 1806. The Shogunate implemented the macroeconomic policy maintaining the deep communication with the financial market and achieved both 'macroeconomic stability' and 'financial market stability'.
N25|Desarrollo económico de Corea del Sur: (1953-1997)<BR>[Economic development of South Korea: (1953-1997)]|In this work, a historical recount is made, decade by decade, of the main milestones and policies that allowed South Korea to achieve its economic development in the second half of the 20th century (1953-1997), how did South Korea achieve it? We will see that, in the initial stages of this process, the Korean State played a vital role, by fostering certain strategic sectors and implementing a set of pragmatic economic policies, depending on the specific circumstances and economic conjuncture. All these public policies and efforts of the private sector had as consequence the creation of a modern and diversified economic structure. The Korean society always had in mind one target: to maximize the economic growth of South Korea.
N25|In the name of God: Managing risk in Islamic finance|In Against the gods: the remarkable story of risk (1996), Peter L. Bernstein illustrates how the mastery of risk has driven modern Western society into converting 'the future from an enemy into an opportunity'. Far from being an antagonist, as the unpredictable whim of gods or mysterious fate, this story has transformed the future into a human prospect, where risk is quantified, measured and managed to mitigate the perils of the unexpected, and where risk-taking, -transfer and -pooling have become per se sources of legitimate profit. Commenting on Bernstein's work while moving from the Western 'risk' to the Arabic رزق 'rizq', '(God's) sustenance', this paper dares looking at human hazard, زهر 'zahr', the 'dice' of future chances, through a comparative and inter-cultural perspective. More precisely, it aims to show how specific anthropological assumptions result in an alternative theory and practice of risk management in a market whose peculiarity is to operate not 'against' but 'in the Name of God': the market of Islamic finance. To this end, Islamic finance is depicted within an anthropology of time where not only the future, but also the present are a divine (rather than human) creation, and where, consequently, risk is deeply re-framed both as a concept and as a source of legitimate profit. In fact, to the extent to which the future remains an economic opportunity in Islam (Q. II:275: 'Allah has permitted trade'), it is not conceived as a human product but as a part of man's responsibility to perform Shari'ah, as God's agent in the 'real'/'right' (haqq). Thus, while any legitimate profit follows liability (al-kharaj bi-l-daman), risk management coherently endorses the primacy of the real economy, exchange equilibrium (with any unlawful increase from riba, gharar or maysir being prohibited), and profit-loss sharing. In other terms, if risk continues to hold an economic value in Islamic finance, this value exists only as legitimate profit (kharaj) through liability (daman), and remains linked to asset-based and commercial activities. As a result, the logic underpinning Islamic banking and insurance (takaful), as well as securities (sukuk) trade, becomes hardly comparable to the conventional one, and rejects financial products, such as derivatives, that are deemed lacking in any commercial value since nothing 'real' is actually traded. To conclude, the paper remarks on how this alternative history of risk in Islam requires further consideration in financial theory and regulation, for the benefit of a level playing field where both conventional and Islamic finance are able to co-exist and prosper under the same (God's) sky.

N25|Financial Synergy in Mergers and Acquisitions in Saudi Arabia|Businesses today consider mergers and acquisitions a new strategy for their company’s growth. Companies aim to grow through sales’ increase, assets purchase, profits’ accumulation and market share gains. The better way for achieving these targets is by getting into either a Merger or an Acquisition. As a matter of fact, growth through mergers and acquisitions has been a critical part of the success of many companies operating in the new economy. Mergers and Acquisitions are an important factor in building up market capitalization. Based on three detailed and in depth structured interviews with major Saudi Arabian banks it has been found that, Mergers motivated by economies of scale should be approached cautiously. Companies should also approach vertical mergers cautiously because it is often difficult to gain synergy through a vertical merger and firms should also seek out mergers which allow the firm to acquire specialized knowledge. It has also been found that the firms should look for mergers that increase market power and avoid unrelated or conglomerate mergers.
N25|Trading patterns at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, 1931-1940|This paper relies on daily price indices for stocks and bonds to analyze the functioning of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) in the period 1931-1940. Although the TSE was a large and liquid market, its pricing mechanisms significantly deviated from weak-form efficiency. In this context, zaibatsu insiders were able to make abnormal returns via informed trading, while other uninformed investors could rely on technical rules to make abnormal profits. The TSE was a risky financial environment in which investors adjusted their portfolios significantly in the aftermath of major events. Potential herding behaviours, price manipulation and reciprocal positive causality (contagion) were observed across markets. These deficiencies may partially explain Japan’s shift to bank-centered finance after WWII.
N25|Financial intermediation and late development in Meiji Japan, 1868 to 1912|Was nineteenth century Japan an example of finance-led growth? Using a new panel dataset of startup firms from the Meiji Period (1868-1912), I test whether financial sector development influenced the emergence of modern industries. Results from multiple econometric models suggest that increased financial intermediation, particularly from banks, is associated with greater firm establishment. This corresponds with the theory of late development that industrialization requires intermediaries to mobilize and allocate financing. The effect is pronounced in the second half of the period and for heavy industries, which may be due to improved institutions and larger capital requirements, respectively.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N25|A Study Of The Gap Between The Expected Specialized Skills Of Accounting Graduates And Actual Level In Iran| Need for valuable experience and knowledge as well as support for graduates are the requirements of growth in societies. The purpose of the present research was to study the difference between the expected administrative and specialized skills of accounting graduates. This research was an applied study in which the data collected using a questionnaire and was analyzed suing Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal- Wallis one-way ANOVA. The population of the research consisted of auditors, financial statement preparers, and financial statement users. The results showed significant differences between the expected and the actual skills of graduates. Also group comparison suggested significant differences in terms of the expected skills, but no significant difference was observed between these groups in their actual skills.
N25|Testing the Effectiveness of Market-Based Controls: Evidence From the Experience of Japan With Short-Term Capital Flows in the 1970s|The paper tests the effectiveness of marginal reserve requirements employed by the Japanese authorities in the 1970s to influence short-term capital flows, thereby contributing to the ongoing debate on the use of capital controls \market- or price-based ones in particular. While the case for using market-based controls almost entirely relies on the mixed evidence from the experience of Chile with unremunerated reserve requirements in the 1990s, testing for their effectiveness on the volume of inflows is hampered by the endogeneity of such a measure, which is typically imposed or intensified when inflows surge. We address this problem by applying the method of propensity score matching and find that an increase in marginal reserve requirements modestly reduced the volume of short-term capital inflows through non-resident free-yen accounts. The impact was not statistically significant, however, implying that the price elasticity of short-term capital flows was small. We conclude that market-based controls must be nearly prohibitive, perhaps combined with administrative measures, to be effective in a meaningful way.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N25|By a Silken Thread: regional banking integration and pathways to financial development in Japan's Great Recession|How do financial development and financial integration interact? We focus on Japan's Great Recession after 1990 to study this question. Regional differences in banking integration affected how the recession spread across the country: financing frictions for credit-dependent firms were more severe in less integrated prefectures, which saw larger decreases in lending by nationwide banks and lower GDP growth. We explain these cross-prefectural differences in banking integration by reference to prefectures' different historical pathways to financial development. After Japan's opening to trade in the 19th century, silk reeling emerged as the main export industry. The silk reeling industry depended heavily on credit for working capital but comprised many small firms that could not borrow directly from larger banks. Instead, silk merchants in Yokohama, the main export hub for silk, provided silk reelers with trade loans. Many regional banks in Japan were founded as local clearing houses for such loans, and regional banks continued to account for above-average shares in lending in the formerly silk-exporting prefectures long after the decline of the silk industry. Using the cross-prefectural variation in the number of silk filatures in 1895 as an instrument, we confirm that the post-1990 decline was worse in prefectures where credit constraints were tightened through low levels of banking integration. Our findings suggest that different pathways to financial development can lead to long-term differences in de facto financial integration, even if there are no formal barriers to capital mobility between regions, as is the case in modern Japan.
N25|Asymmetric dynamics in stock market correlations: Evidence from Japan and Singapore|This paper uses the asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation model developed by Cappiello et al. (2006) to analyze the correlation between the Japanese and Singaporean stock markets and makes two principal findings. First, it finds that financial integration has advanced because of the Japan–Singapore Economic Partnership Agreement, thereby strengthening the bidirectional relationship between Japan and Singapore. Second, it demonstrates empirically that the weight of Asian stocks in portfolios within the Asian region has increased since the global financial crisis, again strengthening the relationships among Asian region economies.
N25|Volatility transmission in regional Asian stock markets|This study aims to investigate the presence of volatility transmission among regional equity markets of Pakistan, China, India, and Sri Lanka. Moreover for developed countries, the stock indices of USA, UK, Singapore, and Japan have been considered. If countries of the same region have a long run relationship then chances of an optimum currency area increases whereas, a diversification strategy to reduce risk is not workable. Results among the developed and Asian countries show that volatility transmission is present between friendly countries of different regions with economic links. We also find some evidence of transmission of volatility between countries which are on unfriendly terms.
N25|Adoptive expectations: Rising sons in Japanese family firms|We find inherited family firms more important in postwar Japan than generally realized, and also performing well on average. Non-consanguineous heir-run firms outperform blood heirs' firms, and roughly match founder-run listed firms, while blood heirs surpass professional managers at running family firms. Further, succession events suggest that adopted heirs “cause” elevated performance. We suggest that heir-run firms do well because non-consanguineous heirs displace the least talented blood heirs, the non-consanguineous heir “job” motivates professional managers, and the threat of displacement encourages blood heirs' effort and human capital accumulation, mitigating the “Carnegie conjecture” that inherited wealth deadens talent.
N25|Conflicts of interest between banks and firms: Evidence from Japanese mergers|This paper assesses conflicts of interest between banks and their client firms via the merger transaction by examining the wealth gain of merger acquirers who were listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1990–2004. The paper reports two main findings. First, acquiring firms did not gain from their acquisitions. Second, acquirers with stronger bank ties experienced larger wealth loss than those with weaker bank ties. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that banks played a conflicted role in mergers during the examination period.
N25|Financial Integration Challenges in ASEAN beyond 2015|Financial integration challenges in ASEAN beyond 2015 can be grouped into two broad classes. The first classes of challenges are the regulatory and infrastructure challenges of financial market integration itself. The second pertains to monetary and fiscal policy regimes and how they are impacted by as well as how they impact on an integrated financial market in the region. The paper focuses on the integration in banking sector and the discussion in it considers the implications that the integration measures or strategies have on monetary policy of a country.
N25|Contained Crisis and Socialized Risk: Unconventional Monetary Policy by the Bank of Japan in the 1890s|In the 1880s, Japan experienced its first stock investment boom, which was highly leveraged by the banking sector. In 1890, its first financial crisis occurred and triggered a de-leveraging process. With a high lower bound of conventional interest rate intervention under the fixed exchange rate regime, the Bank of Japan decided to implement a massive securities purchases first time among major industrial economies and continued this unconventional policy until the early 1900s. We examine how the unconventional intervention for a decade affected the stock prices and trade volumes, and show that the upward distortion in market pricing was considerable and that the equity-risk premium accordingly dropped, which meant socialization of the risk associated with industrial investment.
N25|Analyse empirique des facteurs influençant l’adoption de l’e-banking par les petites entreprises tunisiennes|Les banques tunisiennes mettent à la disposition de leurs clients un ensemble des services bancaires électroniques. Si les recherches ayant étudié les antécédents de l’adoption de l’e-banking par les clients particuliers sont assez nombreuses, peu est connu sur les prédispositions des entreprises tunisiennes à intégrer l’e-banking comme une procédure fiable leur permettant de gérer les différentes opérations financières. L’objectif de cette recherche est d’expliquer dans quelle mesure les intentions d’utilisation régulière de l’e-banking par les responsables des petites entreprises tunisiennes sont déterminées par la sécurité, la qualité de service, les valeurs et la confiance. La collecte des données est effectuée par un questionnaire remplis par les responsables financiers ou chefs de 104 petites entreprises tunisiennes. L’analyse des données par la méthode PLS montrent un effet significatif et positif de la confiance sur les intentions d’utilisation régulière de l’e-banking. La confiance est déterminée par les valeurs fonctionnelles de l’e-banking. Les valeurs fonctionnelles et les valeurs monétaires sont expliquées par la qualité des services et la sécurité. Les implications managériales et théoriques de ces résultats ainsi que les voies futures de recherche sont examinées.
N25|MEDAF avec liquidité : Application au marché boursier tunisien|"Après le relatif échec empirique du MEDAF et la remise en question des variables taille et ratio book-to-market dans le modèle de Fama & French (1992), la question de l’évaluation de couple rentabilité-risque est toujours posée. La littérature théorique et empirique en ce domaine montre l’incapacité des théories traditionnelles du portefeuille (notamment le MEDAF standard) d’expliquer correctement la formation de prix. En effet, ces théories traditionnelles sont basées sur des hypothèses irréalistes, à savoir : l’efficience et la perfection du marché. La théorie de microstructure des marchés, qui se base sur des hypothèses plus réalistes, vient pour proposer des modélisations plus proches de la réalité des marchés boursiers. Dans ce contexte, l’objet de ce travail était d’examiner la problématique relative à la recherche d’une modélisation, fondée sur le concept de la liquidité, se rapprochant aux réalités des marchés des actions qui permettent d’améliorer l’appréhension des éléments fondamentaux régissant la dynamique des prix des actifs financiers. Pour ce faire, à côté du MEDAF standard, nous avons examiné empiriquement deux modèles fondée sur le concept de liquidité, qui peuvent aider à expliquer la manière dont les rendements des titres sont affectés par le coût et le risque d’illiquidité, à savoir : le modèle ""Liquidity-adjusted capital asset pricing model ; LACAPM"" proposé par Viral, Acharaya & Pederson (2004) et le modèle ""the float-adjusted return model FARM"" proposé par weill (2006). Les deux modèles fournissent un cadre théorique confirmant les résultats empiriques selon lesquels les rendements sont affectés par la liquidité (Voir Pasteur et Stambaugh, 2003). A la lumière des tests que nous avons effectué sur un échantillon de 40 titres cotés en continu sur le marché boursier tunisien sur la période allant de 01/02/2011 jusqu’au 31/01/2013, les résultats s’avèrent concluants. D’abord, nous avons mis en évidence l’existence d’un biais d’évaluation. Ensuite, la relation entre les rendements et les estimateurs de coût et risque d’illiquidité est forte ; ceci justifie le passage au MEDAF avec liquidité. Un tel modèle s’avère très puissants et les résultats prouvent l’importance de tenir compte de coûts et risque d’illiquidité dans l’évaluation des titres boursiers. Mots clés : MEDAF, Théorie de microstructure des marchés, liquidité, coût d’illiquidité et risque d’illiquidité."
N25|Cost Components of Interest Rate Charged By Indian Self Help Groups Financed By Not-For Profit Microfinance Institutions|Although, interest rate charged by microfinance stimulate of lot of ethical debate. Very few studies in microfinance detail the cost components of interest rates paid by the borrowers. Setting the optimal interest rate with a dual goal of financial sustainability and fighting against poverty is a complex task for microfinance lending. In this backdrop, this paper examines the various cost components of interest rate changed by Indian Self-Help Groups (SHGs) that are financed by not-for profit Microfinance Institutions (MFIs). The study uses neo-classical framework for the analysis of interest rate determinants like cost of funds, administrative (operating) cost, opportunity cost, travel costs and some margin to sustain the business. The data have come from a survey of 106 women SHGs in ten villages in the state of Karnataka, India. The study finds that the cost of fund and other costs associated in microfinance significantly influence the rate of interest and the SHGs need to reduce efficiently other costs associated with writing and maintaining the accounts, auditing, and hospitality offered, through innovative cost management methods of lending. As a result, there would be a welfare gain for the borrowers through reduced interest rate on loans.
N25|Crowding out redefined: the role of reserve accumulation|It is well understood that investment serves as a shock absorber at the time of crisis. The duration of the drag on investment, however, is perplexing. For the nine Asian economies we focus on in this study, average investment/GDP is about 6 percentage points lower during 1998-2012 than its average level in the decade before the crisis; if China and India are excluded, the estimated decline exceeds 9 percent. We document how in the wake of crisis home bias in finance usually increases markedly as public and private sectors look inward when external financing becomes prohibitively costly, altogether impossible, or just plain undesirable from a financial stability perspective. Also, previous studies have not made a connection between the sustained reserve accumulation and the persistent and significantly lower levels of investment in the region. Put differently, reserve accumulation involves an official institution (i.e., the central bank) funneling domestic saving abroad and thus competing with domestic borrowers in the market for loanable funds. We suggest a broader definition of crowding out, driven importantly by increased home bias in finance and by official capital outflows. We present evidence from Asia to support this interpretation.
N25|China's March to Prosperity: Reforms to Avoid the Middle-income Trap|China is well-placed to avoid the so-called “middle-income trap” and to continue to converge towards the more advanced economies, even though growth is likely to slow from near double-digit rates in the first decade of this millennium to around 7% at the 2020 horizon. However, in order to sustain vigorous growth and improve the well-being of most citizens, renewed reform momentum is required in a number of areas. The following ones are discussed in this paper: financial sector liberalisation; strengthening competition in markets for goods and services; education, research and innovation. Progress is also needed in other areas, notably in fostering more socially-inclusive forms of urbanisation and more environmentally-friendly growth. En marche pour la prospérité : Réformer pour poursuivre le rattrapage en Chine La Chine est bien placée pour ne pas rester un pays à revenu intermédiaire et continuer à converger vers les économies les plus avancées, même si la croissance est vraisemblablement amenée à ralentir, passant d’un rythme à deux chiffres pendant la première décennie de ce millénaire à environ 7% à l’horizon 2020. Toutefois, le maintien d’une croissance vigoureuse et améliorant le bien-être de la majorité des citoyens nécessite une accélération des réformes dans un certain nombre de domaines. Sont passés en revue dans ce document : la libéralisation du secteur financier ; renforcer la concurrence sur les marchés des biens et services ; l’éducation, la recherche et l’innovation. Des progrès sont également requis dans d’autres domaines, notamment pour promouvoir des formes d’urbanisation socialement plus inclusives et une croissance plus respectueuse de l’environnement.
N25|Globalized Banking Sectors: Features and Policy Implications amidst Global Uncertainties|Amidst the global financial uncertainties since 2007, the East and Southeast Asian economies continued to attract a significant bulk of the global banks’ loans to emerging markets, albeit at a decelerating rate. The alleged advantages of these lending are wellknown. Yet the recent interruption to this spectacular rise in international bank lending during the 2007/2008 global financial crisis serves as a stark reminder that international bank lending can rapidly transmit adverse shocks from developed markets to emerging markets. The objective of this study is to identify key features and characteristics of foreign banks’ activities in East and Southeast Asian economies, particularly during the post 2007 global financial crisis period, and to weigh their implications on the local economies, including policy challenges for the central banks and banking supervisors in the region.
N25|A 'Trojan Horse' in Daoguang China?: Explaining the flows of silver (and opium) in and out of China|Economic historians have offered several explanations for China’s cycles of silverisation and de-silverisation in the 18th and 19th centuries focusing either on exogenous supply shortages in world silver markets or an outflow of silver as a consequence of opium imports. This paper challenges both existing “supply-side” and “demand-side” explanations. Section two shows that the supply side change was not a decline in the quantity of silver but in the quality of imported silver coins after the 1820s. Section three shows that this led to a decline in demand because China did not perform as a classic bi-metallic system as usually assumed. Because China lacked monetary sovereignty, the Chinese adopted a foreign coin, the Spanish American peso as the preferred means of payment in some areas of southern China, and increasingly further into the interior. Section four presents evidence for the exchange rate premium of the Spanish American silver coin over other coins and, more importantly, over silver sycee in China after the 1790s. This allowed for large-scale arbitrage by means of acquiring silver sycee in China for export, while bringing coined silver to China. Underlying this sort of 'dollarization' in China was opium. Hence section five shows that opium imports did not trigger the outflow of silver. Instead the flight of silver in fact seems to be the cause for large opium imports.

Tout un pan de l’économie compatible avec la charia accompagne l’essor rapide du capitalisme en Malaisie - première puissance économique d’Asie du Sud-Est après Singapour - d’un point de vue à la fois matériel et éthique. En effet, son développement s’est accéléré depuis plus d’une vingtaine d’années de concert avec la finance islamique, secteur très internationalisé dans lequel la Malaisie représente le principal marché national et occupe une position d’expertise de premier plan à l’échelle mondiale. Cet article de sociologie du développement, faisant notamment écho à des inspirations de Max Weber, revient sur l’institutionnalisation politique de l’islam malaisien pour mettre en évidence son articulation, dans une visée conservatrice, avec l’expansion de la modernité capitaliste.
N25|Taking Back Globalization|Many Americans believe free trade destroyed the U.S. industrial base, and blame foreign workers for taking their jobs. During World War II, Keynes had similar misgivings about the effect of postwar free trade on Britainâ€™s economy. Yet for Keynes, economic forces are never inevitable, and capital rather than labor was the cause of trouble. His 1941 proposal for an International Clearing Union suggested capital controls, forced creditor adjustment, and an international fiat reserve as remedies for deindustrialization. This framework channeled financing toward production rather than speculation, leading to a rising standard of living for workers. A counterfactual with balance of payments data for the United States and China since 1982 suggests his ICU would have prevented U.S. deindustrialization, while yet permitting export-led growth in China.
N25|Relationship between FDI and Economic Growth in Selected Asian Countries: A Panel Data Analysis|This study examines empirically the relationship between FDI and economic growth using heterogeneous panel for the period 1983-2008. The empirical findings of Larsson panel co-integration show that FDI and economic growth are cointegrated. FMOLS results reveal that FDI and economic growth are positively related to each other. The results of panel homogeneous causality hypothesis show the existence of bi-directional causality between FDI and economic growth while the results of panel homogeneous non-causality hypothesis confirm the existence of unidirectional causality running from FDI to economic growth in selected panel. The results of heterogeneous causality hypothesis show the existence of bi-directional causality between FDI and economic growth only in case of Malaysia. The existence of uni-directional causality running from FDI to economic growth is observed in cases of Nepal, Singapore, Japan and Thailand whereas the uni-directional causality is also found running from economic growth to FDI for Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. However, no causality in any direction is found in cases of India, Maldives, Indonesia, China, Philippines, Korea Dem and Singapore.
N25|"Are Japanese Firms Becoming More Independent from Their Banks?: Evidence from the Firm-Level Data of the ""Corporate Enterprise Quarterly Statistics,"" 1994-2009"|"The Ministry of Finance's ""Corporate Enterprise Quarterly Statistics"" (Hojin kigyo tokei kiho) is the only statistical source of well-balanced information about the financing behavior of Japanese firms. Indeed, there are few comparable sources available anywhere in the world. Using this firm-level data set from 1994 to 2009, the author investigates the financing behavior of Japanese firms with over \10 million in paid-in capital. The conclusions contrast sharply with the conventional wisdom. Much of the research and policy discussions about Japanese finance begin from the premise that banks play a decisive role in firm behavior. This paper shows that firms have maintained a dependence on financial institutions well below the level that the conventional wisdom has claimed. Under the recent ""zero-interest-rate, quantity easing"" monetary policy, this ""independence of the firms from the banks"" has increased further. This tendency is clearest among the smaller firms. In turn, this first conclusion raises doubts about the plausibility of the basic premise of research and policy debate on financial issues, and leads us to question whether observers may not have confused a ""crisis of financial institutions"" with a ""financial crisis"". Investigation into firm financing behavior under the ""financial crisis"" from the end of 1997 to the beginning of 1999 does indeed suggest that it was a fiasco caused by the confusion of a ""crisis of financial institutions"" with a ""financial crisis""."
N25|How Should We Bank With Foreigners?â€”An Empirical Assessment of Lending Behavior of International Banks to Six East Asian Economies|ï»¿ï»¿The possible crucial role of international bank lending in transmitting adverse economic disturbance from developed economies to emerging economies in the 2008â€“2009 global financial crisis has placed capital flows into sharper scrutiny in academic and policy discussions. The authors construct macro-and micro-panel data on international bank lending to six Asian economiesâ€”Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailandâ€”to analyze a number of objectives. The paper first examines the influence of critical determinants not only to overall international bank lending but also to cross-border bank lending, and obtained one finding that cross-border lending by international banks tend to pull out from host economies during difficult times in source economies, whereas such retrenchments are not evident on an aggregated basis. This suggests that encouraging brick-and-mortar affiliates of international banks to â€œset up shopâ€ in recipient economies may be the judicious choice for these economies. The paper next examines the differences between subsidiaries and branches of international banks in terms of their ability to shield themselves from the financial difficulties of their global parent banks and thus their ability to continue lending in destination markets. The results show that foreign bank subsidiaries are more capable in this regard. This finding carries with it the attraction of favoring an organizational banking structure that is biased toward subsidiaries. However, national banking regulators should remember that apart from encouraging a host of other domestic and cross-border initiatives, encouraging the entry of brick-and-mortar subsidiaries of international banks should not be viewed as a panacea to financial stability concerns of economies in Asia and in emerging markets in general.

This finding carries with it the attraction of favoring an organizational banking structure that is biased toward subsidiaries. However, national banking regulators should remember that apart from encouraging a host of other domestic and cross-border initiatives, encouraging the entry of brick-and-mortar subsidiaries of international banks should not be viewed as a panacea to financial stability concerns of economies in Asia and in emerging markets in general.
N25|How Should We Bank With Foreigners? An Empirical Assessment of Lending Behaviour of International Banks to Six East Asian Countries|The possible crucial role of international bank lending in the transmission of adverse economic disturbance from advanced economies to emerging economies in the recent global financial crisis has once again placed this type of capital flows into sharper scrutiny both in academic and policy discussions. We construct macro-and micro-panel data on international bank lending to six Asian economies, viz., Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, to analyze a number of objectives. We first examine the influence of a number of critical determinants not only to overall international bank lending but also to cross-border bank lending, and obtained one critical finding in this part of the study that cross-border lending by international banks tend to pull-out from host economies during difficult times in source economies, whereas such retrenchment are not evident on an aggregated basis. This may suggest that encouraging brick-and-mortar affiliates of international banks to ‘set up shop’ in recipient economies may be the judicious choice for these economies. We next critically examine the difference between subsidiaries and branches of international banks in terms of their ability to shield themselves from the financial difficulties of their global parent banks and thus their ability to continue lending in destination markets. According to our results, foreign bank subsidiaries are more capable in this regard. This finding carries with it the obvious attraction of favouring an organizational banking structure that is biased towards subsidiaries. However, national banking regulators should remember that apart from encouraging a host of other domestic and cross-border initiatives, encouraging the entry of brick-and mortar subsidiaries of international banks should not viewed as a panacea to the financial stability concerns not only in Asia but also across emerging markets in general.
N25|Adoptation Of Internet Banking In Uae: Factors Underlying Adoption Characteristics|Technological development has provided tremendous benefits for many industries, including the banking business. The diffusion of internet banking has been witnessed in many countries worldwide. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) recently is one of the most significant economies in its region and in the global arena. Internet banking has been utilized for many years in UAE, and the number of internet banking adopters in UAE has increased steadily. The main focus of this paper was to identify the characteristics of UAE consumers and their attitudes toward the internet banking. Factor analysis suggested seven characteristics important for internet banking adoption, namely compatibility, difficulty, security, trust, third party concern, status, and human contact. Analysis of variance showed that adopters and nonadopters differed on their attitudes toward three factors of adoption: compatibility, trust and human contact. No significant differences were found between attitudes of adopters and non-adopters toward the issues of security, third party concern and status. An interesting finding was that human or physical contact and trust were the most important factors for non-adopters
N25|By a Silken Thread: Regional banking integration and pathways to financial development in Japan's Great Recession|We examine the impact of cross-prefectural differences in financial integration on the regional spread of Japan's Great Recession in the early 1990s. In prefectures with many small manufacturing firms, post-1990 growth was significantly lower if low levels of banking integration with the rest of the country before 1990 existed. The least financially integrated and most credit-dependent prefectures also saw the largest declines in lending by major banks operating nationwide. This suggests that financing frictions were more severe in less financially integrated regions. We then show that cross-prefectural differences in financial integration in the late 20th century can be explained by regionally different pathways to financial development after Japan's opening in the late 19th century. Silk reeling emerged as Japan's main export industry after 1868. The silk industry was heavily dependent on credit for working capital, but silk reelers in the mountainous regions of central Japan generally could not borrow from the large banks in Yokohama or the other major cities. Instead, they either formed local credit cooperatives or local banks were founded with the help of Yokohama silk merchants who then effectively provided the silk reelers with trade credit. The silk regions therefore embarked on a path to financial development in which banking remained centered on a largely mutual or cooperative model and in which banks borrow and lend mainly regionally. Thus, the banking system of the late 19th-century silk-exporting regions was effectively less financially integrated with the rest of the country at the onset of the Great Recession of the 1990s. Using the number of silk filatures per capita at prefecture level in 1895 as an instrumental variable, we corroborate our result that the post-1990 decline was worse in prefectures with low levels of banking integration and high credit dependence.
N25|The formation of the efficient market in Tokugawa Japan|"The first modern futures market is said to date back to the Chicago Board of Trade established in 1848. However, there existed an older precedent; the Dojima Rice Market established in 1730 in Osaka. The past literature on Dojima has made it clear that Dojima had well-established trading systems. However, a important question remains unanswered: whether the first well-established futures market efficient or not? This paper first constructs the daily price index from the original historical document, and applies the test of unbiasedness hypothesis and the classic measure of market efficiency; ""weak-form efficiency"" to Dojima Rice Market, and shows that there existed these types of efficiency."

The analysis starts from the long term effects of the legal reforms, particularly the Ottoman Land Code, on the performance of these markets. Such effects are evident in the evolution of bay-wafa, salam and muzaraah contracts, typical of the rural credit markets, that are recorded in the acts of the Public Notary of Haifa during the years 1890-1915. These contracts show an emerging network of interlinked credit markets, managed by the local notables, at the core of the agricultural growth of late Ottoman Palestine.
N25|Indian Capital Market Review: Issues, Dimensions And Performance Analysis|The purpose of an efficient capital market is to mobilize funds from those who have it and route each them to those who can utilize it in the best possible way. India’s financial market is multi-facet but not balanced. It has state of art equity market but relatively less developed and immature corporate bond market. The Indian capital market in the recent year has undergone a lot of innovation in term regulation and mode of operation. A well developed corporate bond market is also essential for financial system stability, efficiency and overall economic growth. However, If we look at the scenario of capital market in India we find that Indian households have traditionally preferred parking their surpluses in bank deposits, government savings schemes and less than 10% of their investments in financial assets in shares, debentures and mutual funds. The Indian capital market has recently put the worst behind and moved towards strong growth. In this back drop the present paper aims to (i) identify various grey points of Indian capital market; (ii) Evaluated how it performed during post financial crisis period; and (iii) suggests necessary policy reforms for a relatively mature capital market.
N25|'By a Silken Thread': regional banking integration and credit reallocation during Japan’s Lost Decade|During Japan’s ‘Lost Decade’, reallocation of credit through the internal capital markets of country-wide banks mitigated the real effects from the bank liqudity shock in prefectures with many bank-dependent SMEs. We document that the regional fragmentation of banking markets in Japan goes back to the institutions set up for silk export finance in the late 19th century. Using silk as an instrument for modern-day regional banking integration, we find even stronger evidence of credit reallocation than in our baseline OLS-specifications. The sign of this OLS-bias is consistent with the underlying heterogeneity in bank-firm matches implied by the theory.
N25|Determinants of Earnings: Evidence from Pakistan Engineering Sector|Engineering sector plays a considerable role in Pakistan’s economy. The contribution of engineering industry to GDP is $2 billion and it provides employment to significant personnel. The engineering sector in a number of economies of the world, works as a major and speedy engine of economic growth. This study is an attempt to identify the factors affecting the earnings of engineering sector of Pakistan, by using the panel data of twenty-seven engineering firms listed on Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) covering the period of 1990 to 2008. It is found that, in the long run Net Working Capital, and GDP growth has a positive impact on Earnings per Share and Operating Ratio, Net Fixed Assets and GDP deflator has a negative impact while Interest rate has not significant effect on earnings per share.
N25|China’s Foreign Trade: Perspectives From the Past 150 Years|This paper studies the trade of China in the past 150 years, starting from the first opening of China after the Opium War. The main purpose of the paper is to identify what is (and was) China's 'normal' level of foreign trade, and how these levels changed under different trade regimes, from 1840 to the present. We present new evidence on China's foreign trade during the treaty port era (1842-1948), drawn from disaggregated trade data collected by the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, that yields important findings for current research. First, although the volume of foreign trade remained limited initially, there was a notable expansion in the diversity of products, with many new goods being imported into China. Second, the regional diffusion of foreign goods through China was greatly facilitated by the expansions of the port system. Third, the importance of Hong Kong as an intermediary in China's trade has undergone long-term fluctuations suggestive of learning effects. China's recent wave of liberalization has led by the early 1990s to a trade level comparable to the high of the 1920s. While much of China's recent growth in world trade is in line with her income growth, there is no doubt that China's trade openness today, comparable by some measures to Denmark's, is a stunning reversal relative to the pre-1978 and also the pre-1840 period. The paper emphasizes the roles that history and institutional change have played in this.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

N25|Le renminbi doit-il être réévalué ? Les leçons de l'expérience japonaise|There is a similarity of pattern between the present international pressures for RMB revaluation and those which were exerted on Japan in the ?80s for the Yen revaluation. This paper aims at clarifying certain issues of the RMB revaluation debate in the light of Japan?s experience. Two lessons may be drawn from this experience. First the massive revaluation of the Yen against the USD after the 1985 Plaza Agreement did not reduce the US trade deficit, as Japan?s competitiveness was due primarily to the technological quality of its products. The second lesson is that the steep and massive revaluation of the Yen had devastating effects on the Japanese economy, which went through the ?lost decade? during the ?90s. Mutatis mutandis, these lessons may apply today in the case of China. Its currency is indeed undervalued, possibly by 20-25% on a REER basis. However a revaluation of the RMB of such size would not reduce US and European trade deficits as much as expected, because China?s competitiveness is primarily due to its very low cost of labor. Furthermore, the appreciation should be gradual, although sustained, in order to avoid major economic disruptions. But a steady appreciation of the RMB would be in China?s best interest, all the more as it has presently to adjust its model of development. Classification JEL: E2, E5, F10, F31, N15, N25.

N25|The role of the stock market in the provision of Islamic development finance: Evidence from Sudan|This paper assesses the impact of stock exchange funding in the Shari'ya compliant Islamic economy of Sudan. Evidence suggests that while Islamic financial instruments have considerable potential in facilitating development finance through their emphasis on partnership this is better achieved by the banking system rather than the Khartoum Stock Exchange. A case study of the Sudan Telecommunications company shows that larger firms able to cross-list elsewhere are likely to choose regional markets in preference to their domestic one thus benefiting from lower costs of equity. However, governance preferences are likely to favour block shareholders following the Islamic finance partnership concept.
N25|Enforcement of nineteenth century banking contracts using a marriage rule|The enforcement of financial and banking contracts is commonly thought to lie within the domain of government law provision. This paper analyzes a case of self-enforcing financial contracts within a banking system in nineteenth century South India. The Chettiars, a merchant-banking caste, relied on religious homogeneity as well as an endogamous marriage rule, whereby members only married others from within the community, to enforce banking contracts within their system. Widely acknowledged to have been an important source of credit locally and throughout South East Asia, this paper describes and analyzes the enforcement mechanisms at work, in the absence of government involvement. Apart from presenting a new case of self-enforced financial contracts, this paper also represents a novel approach to interpreting the social institution of caste, as seen through the rational choice framework.

Empirical analysis yields that foreign banks are able to charge lower spreads than domestic banks in Turkey. However, findings indicate that the overall level of foreign bank participation in the Turkish banking system does not ffect spreads of domestic banks directly. Instead, the overall level of foreign bank participation in the banking system affects the spreads indirectly through its effects on overhead expenses. Overhead expenses of all banks decrease as foreign bank participation increases.
N25|Crisis and transformation of corporate governance models in Asia (In French)|The objective of this paper is to present the transformations of corporate governance in Asia\r\nsince the crisis of 1997. The analysis deals with 14 Asian countries during the period of 1997-\r\n2006. The important changes include the development of stocks markets, the new role of\r\nbanks and the rise of institutional investors. There is a incessant increase in the market\r\ncapitalization and the number of listed companies on the stock markets. Banks adjust to the new financial environment through diversification of their activities. The capital structure of listed companies is slowly diluted. The significant increase in the participation of institutional investors suggests a possible convergence to a model characterized by dispersed ownership. However, we will show the variety of ownership structure forms in this region.
N25|Interbank Networks in Prewar Japan: Structure and Implications Interbank Networks in Prewar Japan: Structure and Implications|In this paper, we explore the structure and implications of interbank networks in prewar Japan, focusing on director interlocking. We find that approximately half the banks had at least one connection with another bank through director interlocking, and that a bank that had connections with other banks was less likely to fail than a bank without a network. The quality of networks also matters in the sense that the failure probability of a bank with a network was negatively associated with the profitability of the connected banks. On the other hand, there is no strong evidence of financial contagion through networks. In addition, networks of director interlocking contributed to the stabilization of the financial system through coordinating bank mergers.
N25|An Empirical Study on the International Competitiveness of Chinese Commercial Banks|According to the Chinese government’ commitments while entering the WTO, now China has cancelled many restrictions for foreign banks including the restriction of foreign exchange business, the geographic restriction of RMB business and the restriction of the establishment form of foreign banks. Foreign banks are now permitted to offer services to all Chinese clients and to set up the same city services points to make cross-region business. It means that nowadays foreign commercial banks and Chinese commercial banks are standing at the same start line to compete with each other. The innovation of this paper is mainly reflected in the following three aspects. First, we made a complete and systematic summary about the latest achievements on the competitiveness of commercial banks, including the foreign and domestic authoritative method of the evaluation of international competitiveness of commercial banks, in order to build a solid theoretical foundation for the empirical analysis. The second is the multilevel empirical method. In addition to the innovation on the selected indicators of the traditional factor analysis, we also made a cointegration analysis on the macro-level variables which further strengthened the content of the international competitiveness of commercial banks. Thirdly, the data used in the empirical analysis are the latest ones released by the official website of the commercial banks, statistical agencies, regulatory bodies and related database by 2010, in order to ensure the validity and the timeliness of the empirical results.
N25|Explaining the Twin Crises in Indonesia|The co-existence of the ‘twin’ banking and currency crises in emerging market economies has raised concerns regarding the underlying causes and potential remedies. Literatures suggest that there are at least three major approaches that could be used to explain the phenomenon: the microeconomic perspective which emphasizes the role of asymmetric information problems in the banking sector, the macroeconomics perspectives that link the financial liberalization with the banking sector risky behaviors, and the new institutional perspectives incorporating political and financial institutions into the analysis of crisis. Using these frameworks to analyze the twin crises in Indonesia during the 1997-2000 periods, it is suggested that the crises are rooted in and could be well-explained by the asymmetric information model. Although the other models also influence the co-existence of banking and currency crises, it was the asymmetric information problems before and during the crises combined with political turmoil which magnified the contagion effect of the currency crisis in the neighboring countries to the Indonesian economy. Prior to the crises, moral hazard and adverse selection problems both in economic and political fields have significantly contributed to weak micro banking fundamental in the Indonesian banking system. High non-performing loans and weaknesses in the prudential regulation were also evident. Similarly, the post crises experiences demonstrated that uncertainty regarding the economic reform programs and political stability had undermined market confidence, triggered bank panics and worsened currency crisis. Findings of this study are expected to increase understanding on the determinants of twin crises as well as to provide valuable lessons in managing and maintaining robust financial sector in Indonesia.
N25|Cross-border Bank Lending to Selected SEACEN Economies: An Integrative Report|This study seeks to address a number of rising policy concerns from the aftermath of the recent subprime crisis. Did foreign bank lending decline sharply and transmit the financial shocks from the advanced economies to the SEACEN emerging markets? Was the decline driven by the drying-up in supply of cross-border loans or more by the sharp decline in the demand for this funding? Does greater exposure of foreign banks to a host country lower the sensitivity of its claims to shocks originating from their own economies? Are bank claims on a country affected by the aggregate changes in claims on another country? How about the stability of these flows? In short, this study aims to ascertain the various multi-faceted aspects of international bank lending.

N25|Why did Countries Adopt the Gold Standard? Lessons from Japan|Why did policymakers adopt the gold standard? Although previous research has identified ex post effects of gold standard adoption on trade and bond yields, few studies have sought to understand whether these were the actual outcomes of interest to policymakers at the time of adoption. We examine the political economy of Japan's adoption of the gold standard in 1897 by exploring the ex ante motives of policymakers as well as how the legislative decision to adopt gold won approval. We then link the beliefs of contemporaneous policymakers to data so that we can test the economic effects of adoption. In contrast to previous studies examining bond yields, we find little evidence that joining the gold standard reduced Japan's country risk or investors anticipated a dramatic decline in borrowing rates for the government. Moreover, we find no evidence of a domestic investment boom or that investors anticipated one and bid it into stock prices. However, as some policymakers suggested, we find that membership in the gold standard increased Japan's exports by lowering transactions costs and because the price of gold fell relative to silver, making exports to silver standard countries more competitive. While Japan also received a boost in exports to its regional trading partners when it switched from paper to silver, going onto gold allowed Japan to tap into the growing share of global trade that was centered on the gold standard: by the late 1890s nearly 60 percent of Japanese exports and total trade were with members of the gold club.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N25|The Scale of Entrepreneurship in Middle Eastern History: Inhibitive Roles of Islamic Institutions|The historical record belies the claim that Islam impeded entrepreneurship by inculcating conformism and fatalism. However, the diametrically opposed view that Islamic institutions are necessarily supportive of entrepreneurship flies in the face of the historical transformations associated with economic modernization. Islamic institutions that served innovators well in the medieval global economy became dysfunctional as the world made the transition from personal to impersonal exchange. The key problem is that Islamic law failed to stimulate the development of organizational forms conducive to pooling and managing resources on a large scale.
N25|Economic Modernization in Late British India: Hindu-Muslim Differences|The Muslims of South Asia made the transition to modern economic life more slowly than the region’s Hindus. In the first half of the twentieth century, they were relatively less likely to use large-scale and long-living economic organizations, and less likely to serve on corporate boards. Providing evidence, this paper also explores the institutional roots of the difference in communal trajectories. Whereas Hindu inheritance practices favored capital accumulation within families and the preservation of family fortunes across generations, the Islamic inheritance system, which the British helped to enforce, tended to fragment family wealth. The family trusts (waqfs) that Muslims used to preserve assets across generations hindered capital pooling among families, and they were ill-suited to profit-seeking business. Whereas Hindus generally pooled capital within durable joint family enterprises, Muslims tended to use ephemeral Islamic partnerships. Hindu family businesses facilitated the transition to modern corporate life by imparting skills useful in large and durable organizations.

N25|Heat waves or Meteor showers: Empirical evidence from the stock markets|In order to study the volatility spillovers / the transfer of volatilities from spot and futures markets for the period 1st January 2001 to 30th November 2005 with high frequency data i.e., one minute intervals, we have used GARCH models to compute volatilities and VAR models for the returns of different markets and for the volatilities. It is evident that, these VAR models for the volatilities can exhibit the nature of the change in volatility. In a heat wave, the conditional variance of the returns in spot (futures) market depends only upon the past shocks in the given market. For meteor showers, the impact of shocks on spot (futures) markets are transferred from other i.e., futures (spot) markets. With the VAR (1)-GARCH (1,1) analysis, we found that both series are I(1) and that a bi-directional relationship exists between the spot and future market return series. Empirically it is evident that both heat waves and meteor showers exist in Indian spot and futures markets.

The text summarizes the legal background, presents the banks existing during that period, examines their businesses and discusses their contribution to the economic evolution of the territories under consideration. As the paper’s main conclusions, it may be said that: (i) Portuguese colonial banking followed the continental model of government initiative and tight control, not the British model of private initiative without much government control; (ii) the development of Portuguese colonial banking was always mainly a matter of profiting from the opportunities afforded by economic evolution rather than a matter of autonomously fostering the economic development of the territories.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N25|Globalization, Trade & Wages: What Does History tell us about China?|Chinese imports and exports grew rapidly during the first three decades of the twentieth century as China opened up to global trade. Using a new data set on the factor-intensity of traded goods at the industry level, we show that Chinese exports became more unskilled-intensive and imports became more skill-intensive during these three decades. The exogenous shock of World War I dramatically raised the price of Chinese exports and increased the demand for these goods overseas and for unskilled workers producing these goods in China. When the war ended, trade costs declined, leading to a rise in China's terms of trade and further growth in China's export sector. Difference-in-differences regression estimates show that World War I boosted exports in China and did so substantially more for unskilled industries than skilled industries. We show that the observed decline in the skill premium in China is consistent with China's changing terms of trade. The skill-unskilled wage ratio flattened out during the 1910s and then fell by eight percent during the 1920s. We simulate the effects of World War I using a dynamic, general equilibrium factor-endowments model of trade, and demonstrate that an exogenous shock to the price of traded goods can produce a decline in the skill premium similar to what China experienced in the 1920s.
N25|The Shanxi Banks|The remote inland province of Shanxi was late Qing dynasty China's paramount banking center. Its remoteness and China's almost complete isolation from foreign influence at the time lead historians to posit a Chinese invention of modern banking. However, Shanxi merchants ran a tea trade north into Siberia, travelled to Moscow and St. Petersburg, and may well have observed Western banking there. Nonetheless, the Shanxi banks were unique. Their dual class shares let owners vote only on insiders' retention and compensation every three or four years. Insiders shares had the same dividend plus votes in meetings advising the general manager on lending or other business decisions, and were swapped upon death or retirement for a third inheritable non-voting equity class, dead shares, with a fixed expiry date. Augmented by contracts permitting the enslavement of insiders' wives and children, and their relative's services as hostages, these governance mechanisms prevented insider fraud and propelled the banks to empire-wide dominance. Modern civil libertarians might question some of these governance innovations, but others provide lessons to modern corporations, regulators, and lawmakers.
N25|Domestic borrowing without the rate of interest: gharar and the origins of sukuk|All governments need to borrow from the public. Known as domestic borrowing, this is not an easy process. For Muslim countries, where interest is prohibited, this process becomes extra ordinarily difficult. I will start this article by examining the concept of uncertainty, gharar, in Islam and then move on to the origins of Islamic domestic borrowing, which is referred to in modern parlance as sukuk. The value of modern sukuk issued at the end of 2009 has reached roughly USD 100 billions. While most people think that this is a newly invented instrument, the institutional roots can be traced back for centuries.
N25|Role of rural business incubators in translating micro finance to sustainable micro enterprises|Present paper looks at how Rural Business Incubators (RBIs) & Enterprise Resource Centers (ERCs) together with Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) can contribute to inclusive growth. India’s informal sector has a very powerful presence of brilliant entrepreneurs, who can potentially contribute to India’s fight against poverty and have the potential for much more employment & income generation, if appropriate institutional mechanisms are created to provide needed & timely assistance. Here comes the role of RBIs & ERCs and MFIs. Approximately 93 percent of the enterprises are in the informal sector in India. Together with Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), informal sector contributes close to 60 percent to GDP and 40 percent or more to export trade. They create 95 percent of non-farm jobs. Informal enterprises are set-up by owners to alleviate their poverty condition. They could be termed as poverty alleviating enterprises (PAEs). Micro finance institutions need to reach out to such PAEs and empower them. Through the institutional mechanism called RBIs & ERCs, micro financiers can reach out to PAEs. Empowering PAEs and enabling their growth is indeed a challenging task. An institutional mechanism like RBI & ERC is a probable solution to poverty and unemployment. If an incubator & ERC can come up in each of the 6000 block panchayats, that would enable the creation of new enterprises in the formal sector as well as can contribute to empower PAEs in their growth & expansion. This would help create new jobs and alleviate poverty and generate employment. The paper ends with a model RBI & ERC. with a detailed description of service mix that can be delivered through this institutional mechanism.
N25|The economic policy of the Ottoman Empire (1876-1922)|This paper explores the economic policy of the Ottoman Empire during the Abdul Hamid II's reign and the Young Turks period focusing on the fiscal crisis which exposed the Empire to an increasing financial dependence on European capital markets, leading to bankruptcy in 1876 and to the subsequent establishment of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration (OPDA) in 1881. Although tax base rose during the period under consideration, thanks to the long-term effect of the Tanzimat reforms -particularly the Land Code of 1858 - the additional revenues were insufficient to balance the budget deficit. At the same time, the credibility offered to the European investors by the OPDA increased temptation for the Ottoman government to go on contracting new foreign debts. The government's failure to get out of the external debt spiral proved to be fatal to the Empire.
N25|The Relationship between IPO Underpricing Phenomenon & the Underwriter’s Reputation|The primary focus is on studying the under pricing phenomenon in Indian IPO markets. The paper examines the link between the reputation of underwriters to an IPO issue & the level of under pricing of that issue. The underwriters of high reputation have a pricing behavior which is distinct from underwriters in other markets. The investment banks are compared on the basis of the number of issues managed; deal value, syndicate size etc & the top banks were found to under price less as compared to their lower ranked counterparts. The post listing returns are directly related to the number of times the IPO issue is oversubscribed. The study is based on Indian IPO offerings.
N25|CURRENT ISSUES IN ISLAMIC BANKING AND FINANCE:Resilience and Stability in the Present System|The phenomenal worldwide development over the past decade of Islamic banking and finance is drawing much attention to Southeast Asia, which, on the platform of its own economic growth success, is also proving to be the gateway for Middle Eastern petrodollar investments into the two great emerging markets of India and China.This book provides a timely examination of the issues confronting this US$300â€“US$500 billion market growing at 15%â€“20% per annum, with reviews of the different financial markets, be they capital (Sukuk), retail or wealth management. It further includes reviews from the various jurisdictions including Malaysia (the front-runner), Singapore (the regional financial hub), Brunei (an offshore Islamic market player) and the sleeping giant, Indonesia, as well as newly emerging participants such as Japan and the United States. Contributors, all well-known leading practitioners in their fields, range from lawyers, accountants, bankers and educators to policy advisors, and come from institutions such as CIMB, Kuwait Finance House, OCBC Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers, among others.This book, the first of its kind, will be of great benefit to those seeking to better understand current developments and issues affecting Islamic banking in South East Asia, from both global and regional perspectives.
N25|Institutional changes, wars and stock market risk in an emerging economy: evidence from the Israeli stock exchange, 1945–1960|In an effort to understand the determinants of economic growth in an emerging economy, we analyze the effects of institutional reforms, wars and political events on the risk level of the Israeli stock market between 1945 and 1960. We find that the anticipation of wars did not have any effect but the end of skirmishes actually raised the risk on the stock market. Domestic political instability also increased the stock market risk. Finally we find that most legal reforms did not matter much.
N25|How Does Financial System Efficiency Affect the Growth Impact of FDI in China?|In spite of being the second largest recipient of FDI in the world, China shows limited evidence of considerable FDI benefits on growth (Fan and Hu 2007; Luo 2007; Ran et al. 2007). Motivated by Alfaro et al.s (2003) model, this study tests whether poor financial market development might be responsible for the relatively low benefits of FDI on growth in China. We apply BlundellBond system GMM estimators to a panel of Chinese provinces. Our results indicate that poor financial intermediation does indeed limit the transmission of FDI benefits within the Chinese economy. Moreover, the study reveals preliminary evidence that banks credits to unproductive State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) constitute poor financial intermediation with negative growth implications. In contrast, credits to small private enterprises are associated with a positive impact of FDI on growth.

N25|Can an Islamic model of housing finance cooperative elevate the economic status of the underprivileged?|A formal home loan is onerous to subprime borrowers in efficient markets. This can deter homeownership for financially strapped individuals, leading to a market failure. This paper proposes a special form of cooperative mortgage financing (practiced in Oman) to overcome this market failure. We integrate the literature of mortgage design with that of informal savings schemes (i.e., ROSCAs/ASCRAs) to illustrate that this mode of financing dissipates credit risk better than the formal mode of financing. It is also resilient to volatility of interest rates and allows prepayments without any additional charges. Finally, we verify the assertions of Besley et al. (1994) and Hart and Moore (1998) that cooperative mortgages are pareto-superior to formal mortgages in special cases.
N25|Stock Prices in a Speculative Market: The Chinese Split-Share Reform|In 2005-2006 China reformed its stock market by eliminating non-tradable shares. The regulator set general guidelines and then assigned responsibility for implementation to each company. We derive relations that should have been followed by the prices of stocks and exploit a company-level data set to compare the actual and the theoretical price reactions. We find evidence for abnormal returns both before the beginning of the reform and during the reform. Cross-sectionally, abnormal returns are associated mainly with turnover and compensation. This shows that in a speculative market, investors do not properly react to unambiguous corporate actions.

N25|Professor Jeremiah Jenks of Cornell University and the 1903 Chinese Monetary Reform|The Boxer uprising in China (1900) killed quite a number of foreigners and missionaries, which induced the armies of eight Western powers to invade China and they imposed an indemnity of 400 million silver taels. The international silver price around the 1900s was slumping, and these indemnity-treaty powers (e.g. France, UK, Germany, and Belgium) strongly wished China to establish a silver monetary system that would be maintained at parity with gold. Professor Jeremiah Jenks (1856-1929) of Cornell University was mandated to establish a gold-exchange standard for China. This paper begins with Jenks's life and work and the background of his mission to China. Section 2 presents the basic principle of this reform project and its specific designs. Section 3 assesses reactions and criticisms on Jenks's proposal. Possible arbitrage activities between gold and silver are analyzed in Sections 4 in order to evaluate the sustainability of Jenks's system. We conclude that: (1) Jenks's new systemm ight have been stable in 1904-16 and 1928-30; (2) technically speaking, this was a remarkable design.
N25|Did the Structure of Trade and Foreign Debt Affect Reserve Currency Composition? Evidence form Interwar Japan|Historical experience is often invoked in the modern debate on competition among reserve currencies, yet little is known about quantitative aspects or institutional features of reserve management. By drawing on newly obtained data on foreign exchange reserves, especially those broken down by currency, this paper explores the competition between the British pound sterling and the U.S. dollar for the status of leading reserve currency in Japan during the interwar period. We find that competition between these two currencies remained undecided and that their relative status alternated repeatedly. Historical materials and the results of econometric analysis suggest that the key factors explaining a choice of reserve currencies are trade volumes and the currency denomination of external debt. The latter criteria supported maintaining sterling fs status as a reserve currency for the interwar period, reflecting its considerable share in debt service generated through issues that had been launched when London was the sole international market. The stability of potential reserve currencies is shown to be crucial as well. We also find evidence of institutional factors, which include taxation, foreign exchange controls, and restrictions on financial activities.
N25|A Financial System Perspective on Japan's Experience in the Late 1980s|This paper revisits the events of the 1980s bubble in Japan in light of the lessons learned from the subprime crisis in the United States. Our focus is on the role played by sectoral developments in the financial system in Japan. We highlight the transformation of a subset of non-financial firms (the large manufacturing firms) from being net debtors to the banks to becoming net creditors to the banks, thereby becoming part of the financial intermediary sector. In this way, large manufacturing firms in Japan played the role of surrogate wholesale banks that increased the overall supply of credit to the economy. When good borrowers already had credit and yet loose monetary conditions encouraged greater credit supply, credit availability to marginal borrowers and to real estate-related sectors increased. We discuss the role of market conditions and monetary policy in this development.
N25|Part-Paid Stock, Corporate Finance, and Investment: Economic Consequences of the Part-Paid Stock System and Supplementary Installments in the Early 1930s of Japan|Under Japan fs prewar capital stock system of joint-stock companies, rather than paying the full face value of a share in one lump sum, shareholders paid for stocks in multiple installments. This system was transplanted from industrialized Western nations during the Meiji Era to make it easier for investors to buy company shares and to promote capital concentrations. Company directors determined the amount of supplementary installments on part-paid stocks and when these installments were paid. The Commercial Code and Corporate articles of association specified sanctions for nonpayment, giving companies the backing needed to call in supplementary installments. Supplementary installments functioned as a last resort for corporate fund-raising in times of financial distress and played a role in corporate cash management and investment. Studies of historical documents such as financial statements and company histories show that in the early 1930s of the Great Depression, in a time of tight financial markets, many companies raised funds through supplementary installments, applying these funds to make investments and repay debts. As part of our study, we construct a new corporate financial data set with data on supplementary installments encompassing 174 firms, based on the Mitsubishi Economic Research Institute fs Honpo Jigyo-Seiseki Bunseki (Performance analysis of Japanese companies) and Toyo Keizai fs Kabushiki Gaisha Nenkan ( Company Year Book) and estimate cross-sectional investment functions for the fiscal year of 1932. Regression results suggest that while corporate investments were subject to liquidity and debt constraints, supplementary installments stabilized corporate cash management and promoted corporate investment activities.
N25|Choice of the Path of Fiscal and Monetary Policy Coordination in China|The role of monetary policies regulating social the aggregate demand is highlighted, while the role in restructuring the supply and demand are greater limitations. The Central Bank indirectly affects the currency in circulation and the total size of credit by adjusting the statutory deposit reserve rate, the rediscount rate, open market operations; The Central Bank increases or decreases in money supply by limiting the loan quota and the currency issuance. Thus the role of the monetary policies in alleviating serious problems in the field of circulation area is more rapid, clear and effective. However, the central bank can not loan directly to a large number of economic development in lagging industries especially public goods industries as a result of the restrict of the credit funds movement, and therefore the role of monetary policies in improving the social structure and the rate relationship of national economy is relatively limited. The structural imbalance between domestic demand and external demand makes the Chinese economy affected seriously in the circumstances of the U.S. financial crisis and a sudden decline in global demand.
N25|Going Bankrupt? Business Failure in Colonial Indonesia, c. 1870-1940|Bankruptcy represents a highly evasive feature of business activity when it comes to interpretation. Statistics convey the ups and downs of business cycles and genuine business failures but also strategies of readjustment. There was a careful registration of declared bankruptcies in late colonial Indonesia but so far the preserved data have not been utilized for purposes of economic historical analysis. This article, based on primary evidence from the colonial period, seeks to fill that gap in the historiography. The article presents an overview of available sources, including a discussion of ambiguities in interpretation. The actual analysis consists of two parts, one concerning the period from the late 1860s up to the first decade of the twentieth century when the basis for laid for a rapid export-led economic expansion. The second part of the analysis embraces the period of expansion, in particular during the 1920s, as well as the downturn during the worldwide economic depression in the 1930s. Particular attention is given to evidence from major commercial centres in Java such as Batavia (Jakarta), Surabaya and Semarang. The statistical record highlights the stability in the bankruptcy pattern up to 1920 followed by sharp oscillations, including dramatic peaks in the early 1920s and early 1930s. Strikingly, sustained losses registered in declared cases of bankruptcy were significantly larger during the 1920s than the 1930s which testifies to a large-scale corporate restructuring through the device of bankruptcy during the former decade. Findings also underscore the conspicuous presence of ethnic Chinese among businessmen filing for bankruptcy but their share declined in the course of time as more European firms went bankrupt.

N25|„What did guide investors decisions” during the classical gold standard era? The case of Ottoman Empire, 1880-1914|It has been conventionally argued that the gold standard, as a “good housekeeping seal of approval”, provided an easy access to the international financial markets for the peripheral countries during the classical gold standard era. This paper, by relying on the Ottoman case, questions the importance of the gold-related monetary regime (limping gold standard) as a determinant of investors’ decisions, and attempts to answer the question of “what did guide the investors’ decisions” by relying on the revisionist gold standard literature and historical data. It is concluded that International Financial Control exercised by the representatives of the creditors on the Ottoman finances was an important determinant of the cost of borrowing which was neglected by the literature.

N25|The impacts of economic structures on the performance of simple policy rules in a small open economy|Applying a stochastic dynamic general equilibrium model, the performance of various simple rules is analyzed in a small open economy context. The aspects that are considered in the analysis include the degree of exchange rate pass-through, trade openness, the policy objective and the source and persistency of shocks. The main objective of this analysis is to investigate if the rule reacts to exchange rate performs better than the basic closed economy rule without exchange rate term. Comparison on the performances is also made between the consumer inflation targeting and domestic inflation targeting rules. The results show that adding the exchange rate term to the policy rule enhances improvement especially in the higher pass-through case. The superior rule is the hybrid rule that reacts to the exchange rate term. CPI inflation targeting rules outperform the domestic inflation targeting rules in term of welfare loss. However, more complicated domestic inflation targeting rules generate lower loss in term of relative loss. On the second part of this chapter, comparisons on the performances of different exchange rate regimes are made under different source and persistency of shocks. The floating (pegged) regime is favored under more prominent real (nominal) shocks. The results suggest that emerging countries that experience very large real shocks should float their exchange rate.

It presents theories which explain relation between price level, labor productivity and exchange rate. These theories explain the process of how the long-run equilibrium exchange rate is being achieved. On the other hand it elaborates on short-run exchange rate deviations. As the key factor which cause the deviations identified in the paper is presence of the prices of non-tradable goods in price indexes. Proposed is a case study which clarifies the process of equilibrium exchange rate achieving to emphasis some of the theoretical conclusions made in paper. Verification of theoretical conclusions is sketched out through the Big Mac Index statistics. Statistics is to prove proposed relations between price levels and exchange rates in different countries and is to verify the relevance of theoretical conclusions about long-run equilibrium of exchange rates.
N25|Important Lessons from Studying the Chinese Economy|In 1979 the United States and China established normal diplomatic relations, allowing me to visit China and study the Chinese economy. After doing so for thirty years since and advising the government of Taiwan in the 1960s and the 1970s and the government of the People?s Republic of China in the 1980s and the 1990s this is an opportune moment for me to summarize the important lessons that I have learned. The lessons will be summarized in four parts: on economic science, on formulating economic policy and providing economic advice, on the special characteristics of the Chinese economy and on the experience of China?s economic reform. At the beginning I should comment on the quality of Chinese official data on which almost all quantitative studies referred to in this article were based. Chow (2006(a)) has presented the view that by and large the official data are useful and fairly accurate. The main justification is that every time I tested an economic hypothesis or estimated an economic relation using the official data the result confirmed the well-established economic theory. It would be a miracle if I had the power to make the Chinese official statisticians fabricate data to support my hypotheses. Even if I had had the power, most of the data had already been published for years before I conceived the ideas of the studies reported in this article.

Dès son origine, l'institution financière génère des craintes en Occident sur sa puissance financière supposée et sur les interférences politiques possibles qui pourraient en faire une arme de guerre économique. Un an après, alors que la crise a transformé ses premiers investissements emblématiques en fardeau financier et en déficit d'image, le fonds souverain cherche surtout à se protéger des critiques qu'il subit dans son propre pays et a momentanément gelé ses opérations internationales. Par sa participation à la définition des principes de Santiago sous l'égide du FMI, il a démontré sa volonté d'ouverture mais le manque de transparence de ses structures de décision, de sa stratégie et des modalités opérationnelles de ses investissements continuent de le stigmatiser dans les classements internationaux consacrés aux fonds souverains.

N25|Size and Scale Economies in Japanese Cooperative Banking|The Japanese banking industry, including the cooperative sector has been restructured following the crisis of the 1990s. Here we examine the relationship between size and scale economies of cooperative banks in Japan (namely Shinkin and credit cooperatives). We use the translog cost-function methodology and intermediation approach coupled with a large set of both cross-sectional and panel data over the period 2003 to 2006. We find significant diseconomies of scale for both the full sample and sub-samples of small and large cooperative banks. It is of interest to note that larger cooperative banks were at cost disadvantage as compared to small ones throughout most of the period. Thus, bigger is not always better. Shinkin and credit cooperative banks need to make further efforts to assess the business environment and strengthen profitability by, for example, expanding the range of financial services they offer in their regional areas and making further progress in risk management.
N25|The Relationship between Risk, Capital and Efficiency: Evidence from Japanese Cooperative Banks|The risk-capital positions of Japanese banks have been under tension throughout the 1990s. However, existing theory on the determinants of bank risk-taking still remains limited and the evidence is conflicting. Most studies concentrate on US and European banks, while empirical evidence has remained scarce for Asian banks. Added to that, to our knowledge, there are almost no papers on this subject for cooperative banks in Japan. Thus, the main contribution of this study is to shed some light on the determinants of bank risk-taking and analyse its relationship with capital and efficiency in Japanese cooperative banking (namely shinkin and credit cooperatives banks). This paper focuses on Japanese cooperative banks as they constitute an important segment of the Japanese banking sector. We employ a simultaneous equation model in which the relationships between, risk, capital and cost inefficiency are modelled. Two stage least squares with fixed effects estimation procedure are applied to a panel data set of 263 Japanese cooperative banks over the period 2003 through 2006. The results confirm the belief that risk, capital and inefficiency are simultaneously determined. The empirical model shows a negative relationship between risk and the level of capital for Japanese cooperative banks. Inefficient Japanese cooperative banks appear to operate with larger capital and take on more risk. These arguments may reflect the moral hazard problem that exists in the banking system through exploitation of the benefits of deposit insurance. We also assess the size effects and find that larger cooperative banks holding less capital take on more risk and are less efficient.
N25|Information Memory and Pricing Efficiency of Futures Contracts|The present study investigates the information dissemination efficiency of the Indian equity futures market. Daily log returns of all indices as well as individual stock futures contracts understudy have been found to be non-normal and responding asymmetrically to the information shocks. Volatility clustering in daily log returns of all indices and individual stock futures contracts has been identified, which suggests that Indian equity futures market is not an efficient price-discovery vehicle. In addition, the present study finds an evidence of leverage effect, which implies that traders assign more weightage to bad news, whereas, they cautiously react to positive news. Mean reversion in daily log returns of the Indian equity futures market further suggests that traders (especially retail traders) need to be overcautious while adding equity futures as leverage products in their portfolio because in a highly volatile market, framing a trading rule to earn super normal profit may be an easy task for big/institutional traders but may not be possible for small/uninformed traders.
N25|Islamic Alternatives to Purely Capitalist Modes of Finance: A Study of Malaysian Banks from 1999 to 2006|Like Western financial markets, Islamic modes of finance offer services characterized by profit-and-loss sharing while also providing certain debt-based instruments. Unlike traditional capitalist modes of finance, however, Islamic finance places a unique emphasis upon the former, thus prompting many comparisons between the performance of Islamic banks and conventional ones. Given the mixed results of these studies, our paper analyzes eight banks in Malaysia offering both conventional and Islamic banking operations. Our comparison is conducted via discussions of profitability, liquidity, and asset quality. It is illustrated via this micro-level analysis that Islamic modes of finance may generally equal or surpass the quantitative measures of performance describing traditional capitalist finance systems and simultaneously encourage higher levels of social equity and economic stability in the era of financialization.

N25|Innovations And Informal Institutions:An Institutionalist Approach To The Role Of Social Capital For Innovation|This article seeks to add to the debate on the role of informal institutions on innovations within firms. It argues that social capital arising from informal institutions can either help innovation or inhibit it within small enterprises. The paper attempts to provide a conceptual framework of how social capital fosters innovation within small firms. Like physical and human capital, social capital is also considered an explanatory factor in theories of innovation. Social networks become an essential element in the economic activity of the small businesses as they are more likely to rely on them to obtain information and learn about new techniques of productions due to their smaller resource base.

N25|Türkiye'de Bankacılığın Tarihsel Gelişimi (Historical Development of Banking Sector in Turkey)|Beginning from 1840s, the revenue needs of the Ottoman goverment stimulated the development of banking in the Otoman Empire. Foreign banks sovereigned the banking sector until 1920s. At the beginning of the twentieth century, as a result of credit needs of local businessmen, local banks were set up. This process continued through the first quarter of the twentieth century. By 1923, there were 20 local banks and 15 foreign banks operating in Turkey. In 1920s, national and investment banking started but legislation was made after the Great Depression. Central Bank was set up in 1930. The initial steps in the promotion of the banking sector were undertaken in 1930s. Government established some banks in the 1930s in order to finance industrialization while the number of foreign banks decreased to 9. After the World War II, a number of private national banks increased and branch network was expanded. In 1960s, the affiliations of banks in industrial firms increased. Between 1958 and 1980 banking sector was highly repressed and controlled by Central Bank. Beginning from January 24,1980 financial irregulation policies had an impact on the scope and content of the banking sector in Turkey. A number of banks increased but, uncontrolled free market created a vast problems in the financial sector. Open economy and insufficient legislation in this area made banking sector very vulnerable. At the end of the subsequent financial crises, banking sector was restructured and controlled after 2001. As a result of globalization the share of foreign banks has been expanded in the banking sector in the first decade of 21th century.
N25|The evolution of trading activity in Asian foreign exchange markets|The development of Asian foreign exchange markets has progressed appreciably in recent years. Data from the BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey indicate that the turnover of Asian currencies rose sharply between 2004 and 2007, financial institutions became more important customers, and the participation of non-residents increased. Notwithstanding this progress, the liquidity of Asian foreign exchange markets continues to be undermined by foreign exchange controls. For Asian currencies other than HKD and SGD, non-residents account for a relatively small share of activity and FX swap markets are still in their infancy. Offshore non-deliverable markets have developed in response to controls, causing trading activity to fragment. Furthermore, Herstatt risk remains high in Asian foreign exchange markets. Almost all transactions between Asian currencies are executed via the US dollar so, for those trades not cleared through CLS Bank, each leg is settled at significantly different times.
N25|Towards An Asian Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bretton WoodsÃ¢â‚¬Â for Restructuring of the Regional Financial Architecture|Despite a plethora of programs for increased financial co-operation in Asia, there has been very little real progress in developing a regional architecture for financial co-operation in Asia. While the risks of repetition of 1997-98 style financial crisis in Asia are not high today, there are new risks of financial turbulence originating from sub-prime crisis in the US and new opportunities for using the financial strength of the region for accelerated growth with equity. To guard against these risks and to exploit these opportunities, a bold new initiative in the region is needed. The idea of Asian Monetary Fund proposed by Japan in 1998 needs to be revived, perhaps with a different nomenclature and a different terms of reference. This paper proposes a Reserve Bank of Asia which will be a combination of IMF and the World Bank at regional level. In order to respond to the current crisis, the major players in the region should develop a consensus on the outline of a regional financial architecture and call a conference of EAS countries to prepare Articles of Agreement for the institution much as was done at Bretton Woods some sixty years ago.
N25|Trade, Institutions and Religious Tolerance: Evidence from India|This paper analyses the incentives that shaped Hindu and Muslim interaction in India's towns from the rise of Islam to the rise of European intervention in the 17th century; it argues that differences in the degree to which medieval Hindus and Muslims could provide complementary, non-replicable services and a mechanism to share the gains from exchange has resulted in a sustained legacy of religious tolerance. Due to Muslim-specific advantages in Indian Ocean shipping, incentives to trade across ethnic lines were strongest in medieval trading ports, leading to the development of institutional mechanisms that further supported inter-religious exchange. Using new town-level data spanning India's medieval and colonial history, this paper finds that medieval trading ports were 25 percent less likely to experience a religious riot between 1850-1950, two centuries after Europeans disrupted Muslim dominance in overseas shipping. Medieval trading ports continued to exhibit less widespread religious violence during the Gujarat riots in 2002. The paper shows that these differences are not the result of variation in geography, political histories, wealth, religious composition or of medieval port selection, and interprets these differences as being transmitted via the persistence of institutions that emerged to support inter-religious medieval trade. The paper further characterises these institutions and the lessons they yield for reducing contemporary ethnic conflict.
N25|Works On Public Finance By The Sixteenth Century Muslim Scholars| The subject of public finance and taxation marked the beginning of systematic and rather exclusive writing on economic issues in Islamic scholarship in its earliest period. Within a few centuries, a large number of works came out on the subject. This trend continued in the later centuries but with a difference in quantity, quality and style. Their number decreased, coverage contracted and they increasingly tended to deal with specific issues. Writings in the later centuries were characterized by imitation and repetition. In the sixteenth century the major works on the subject included the works of al-BalOEtunus¥ “Tahr¥r al-MaqOEl F¥ mOE Yahull wa Yahr´m min Bayt al-MOEl” and Ibn Nujaym’s “RisOElah fi’l-kharOEj” and “Fi Mas’alOEt al-JibOEyah wa’l-RatibOEt wa’l- Mu’sharOEt al-DiwOEniyyah.” From the Persian speaking East, Fadl-Allah Khunji discussed the Islamic provision of public finance in much detail in his work Sul´k al-Mul´k, a very comprehensive treatment of the subject in that period. In Safawid Iran the issue of kharOEj was a very controversial topic and centered on whether the acceptance of a stipend from kharOEj income was permissible for religious scholars.
N25|Bank Borrowing and Financing of Medium-sized Firms in Indonesia|"The improvement of financial intermediation functions is crucial for a robust banking system. When lending, banks have to cope with such problems as information asymmetry and adverse selection. In order to mitigate these problems, banks have to product information and improve their techniques of lending. During the 1998 financial crisis, Indonesia's banking system suffered severe damage and revealed that the country's banking intermediation functions did not work well. This paper examines the financial intermediation functions of banks in Indonesia and analyzes the importance of bank lending to firms. The focus is on medium-sized firms, and ""relationship lending"", one of the bank lending techniques, is used to examine financial intermediation in Indonesia. The results of logit regressions show that the relationship between a bank and a firm affects the probability of bank lending. The amount of borrowing and collateral are also affected by a firm's relationship with a bank. When viewed from the standpoint of relationship lending to medium-sized firms, Indonesian banks cannot be criticized for any malfunction of financial intermediation."
N25|Rise of the Japanese fiscal state|A sustainable fiscal state needs to have two critical factors: A stable tax base and access to an efficient bond market. The Tokugawa Shogunate had a stable land tax revenue, which was inherited to modern Japan after the Meiji restoration. Taxation, however, was restricted by the constitution after the Meiji restoration. The parliament opposed to expansionary policy in the early 1890s, and then it turned to support that at the exchange of governmental commitment to investment in social infrastructure. The government committed to investment to increase productivity, and was allowed to raise tax rate. About the bond market, at the other hand, the government had issued bonds only in the domestic market until the mid 1890s. In the late 1890s, after Japan joined the international gold standard, the government began to issue considerable amount of bonds, and the balance surged during the Russo-Japanese war in 1904-1905. Now the London market efficiently financed Japanese government. In the early 20th century, the government was one and only one player that had established its own reputation in the international financial market. Hence balance of Japanese government bonds was the only route to import capital. This route also provided Japanese economy with macroeconomic stability, offsetting short-term current account deficit by import of capital. Japan had finally been equipped with necessary instruments as a stable and sustainable fiscal state.
N25|Contract Enforcement and Institutions among the Maghribi Traders: Refuting Edwards and Ogilvie|Edwards and Ogilvie dispute the empirical basis of the view that a multilateral reputation mechanism mitigated agency problems among the eleventh-century Maghribi traders. They allege that the relations among merchants and agents were founded in law. This paper refutes this assertion using comprehensive quantitative analyses of all available primary sources and a careful review of the documents and the literature Edwards and Ogilvie cite. Among recent new quantitative findings reported: (1) less than one percent of the documents’ content is devoted to legal activity on any matter. (2) The legal system was mainly used for mandatory, non-trade related matters. (3) The documents reflect thousands of agency relations but there are less than six court documents possibly reflecting its use in agency disputes. (4) A ten percent random sample of all the documents finds no trade-related legal actions among Maghribis beyond those in the court documents. (5) About 75 percent of agency relations were not based on a legal contract. The paper also reaffirms the accuracy of Greif’s documentary examples and sheds light on the roles of the legal system and reputation mechanism during this period.
N25|"Evolution of Rural Financial Market in China: An Institutional ""Lock in"" or Gradualism?"| Historically, China's political attempts to provide access to rural credit has met with mixed results and an institutional structure that often strays from intended policy goals. There has been a close correspondence between financial depression and many policy-driven financial institutions that dominated the rural financial system in China. More recently, ongoing reforms are dedicated towards a gradual liberalization within the system. In this study, we explore the context of agricultural transition and political process as defined by the various interlinkages across the Chinese rural financial system. We find that there has been negligible progress in the evolution of the rural financial market in China. The policy-led financial institutions ended up as merely a disbursement window and a costly drain on state budget. Institutional changes were locked in by patching up the existing institutions.
N25|Risk in carry trades: a look at target currencies in Asia and the Pacific|We analyse carry trades involving the Australian dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Indian rupee, New Zealand dollar and Philippine peso as target currencies. We find evidence supporting the view that downside risk is an important feature of such strategies and propose ways of measuring this risk.
N25|Business Groups and the Big Push: Meiji Japan's Mass Privatization and Subsequent Growth|Rosenstein-Rodan (1943) and others posit that rapid development requires a 'big push' -- the coordinated rapid growth of diverse complementary industries, and suggests a role for government in providing such coordination. We argue that Japan's zaibatsu, or pyramidal business groups, provided this coordination after the Meiji government failed at the task. We propose that pyramidal business groups are private sector mechanisms for coordinating and financing 'big push' growth, and that unique historical circumstances aided their success in prewar Japan. Specifically, Japan uniquely marginalized its feudal elite; withdrew its hand with a propitious mass privatization that rallied the private sector; marginalized an otherwise entrenched first generation of wealthy industrialists; and remained open to foreign trade and capital.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N25|The Use of Real Estate for the Settlement of Claims in Roman Palestine|The Mishna in Tractate Gittin discusses land qualities, in a context where land is used to settle monetary obligations. The law is that land of different qualities must be used to pay claimants in different situations; in particular, claimants pursuant to a tort case have the right to have their claim paid with land of the best quality. Creditors have the right to be paid with land of medium quality, while women who are owed money as part of a ketuba (marriage contract) claim may have to be satisfied with land of the lowest quality. However, the total value of the land received by each claimant is just the amount they are owed it is independent of the quality of the land that is used to pay them. This being the case, the purpose of the legislation is unclear. In this paper, I explore the possibility that the law is designed to minimize the total amount of transactions costs.
N25|French banks in Hong Kong (1860s-1950s): Challengers to British banks?|French banking expansion in China and South-East Asia had to respect the powerful influence of British banks there. From the 1860s French merchant and banking interests had been involved in Hong Kong business because of the colonial developments in Indochina and the links between this area and the Hong Kong centre. The growth of commercial links between the colony and China favoured further integration of banking and currency exchanges with Hong Kong, through the Banque de l’Indochine corporation, competing with Hsbc. It was itself committed to finance Asian-French commercial flows (silk, etc.) directly (Lyon, Bordeaux, Paris) or indirectly (London branch) took part to banking links with France. But Hong Kong also became a bridgehead for Banque de l’Indochine into southern China (Canton, etc.) from the1890s up to the 1930s and, in parallel with the Shanghai branch, its branch there asserted itself as a part of French expansion in the Far-East.

N25|Capital Market Integration In Japan|We construct new quarterly estimates of lending rates for 47 Japanese prefectures for the period 1886-1922, and test the extent to which regional capital markets integrated during this period. We analyze whether the capital market was efficient, estimate the speed of convergence among the rates, and assess the degree to which different regions were integrated with the main financial centers of Japan. Interest-rate differentials between the financial centers of Japan and other regions do not follow a random walk, and hence are suggestive of market efficiency ? in the sense that arbitrage opportunities did not persist. Results from cointegration tests suggest that the integration in Japan is characterized by multiple stochastic elements. We find the existence of four long-run cointegrating relationships. We also find evidence that shocks occurring in a financial center, such as the Kanto region, were transmitted to outlying regions and had permanent, but small effects on their rates.
N25|Were Banks Really at the Center of the Prewar Japanese Financial System?|For many years, the dominant view of the Japanese financial system before World War II has been that industrial bank-type banks were at the center, and research emphasizing the role played by capital markets has generally been in the minority. Recent years, however, have seen the publication of research highlighting the development of prewar stock markets, which has sparked a debate challenging the accepted theory. This paper contains a comprehensive reconsideration of the roles played by banks and stock markets from both a quantitative and a qualitative perspective. On the quantitative side, it examines the structure of assets and liabilities in the private nonfinancial sector and long-term data on fund-raising by major manufacturing and public-sector enterprises. It concludes that while the private nonfinancial sector was in general strongly dependent on bank borrowings, when the focus is narrowed to large enterprises there was a high degree of dependence on equity fund- raising. While diachronic trends can be seen in these characteristics, it is clear that they stem from differences in data coverage and not from any basic changes in systems. On the qualitative side, the paper compares the roles played by banks and stock markets in two areas: resource allocation functions (information production functions and risk-bearing functions) and corporate governance functions. While stock markets did play some role in corporate governance, the paper concludes that resource allocation functions were only exhibited within a narrow group of wealthy individuals. On the other hand, banks played a large role in resource allocation functions by supplying risk money, but the paper concludes that their corporate governance functions were insufficient.
