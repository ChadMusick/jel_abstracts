F31|Foreign Reserve Accumulation, Foreign Direct Investment, and Economic Growth|This paper develops a quantitative small-open-economy model to assess the optimal pace of foreign reserve accumulation by emerging and developing countries. In the model, reserve accumulation depreciates the real exchange rate and attracts foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, which promotes productivity growth through endogenous firm dynamics. The economy is also subject to sudden stops in the form of an occasionally binding constraint on foreign borrowing, and accumulated reserves are used to prevent severe economic downturns. The model shows that two factors are the key determinants of the optimal pace of reserve accumulation: the elasticity of the foreign borrowing spread with respect to foreign debt, and the entry cost for FDI entry. The model suggests that these two factors can explain a substantial amount of the cross-country variation in the observed pace of reserve accumulation.
F31|Covered Interest Parity Deviations: Macrofinancial Determinants|For several decades until the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), Covered Interest Parity (CIP) appeared to hold quite closely—even as a broad macroeconomic relationship applying to daily or weekly data. Not only have CIP deviations significantly increased since the GFC, but potential macrofinancial drivers of the variation in CIP deviations have also become significant. The variation in CIP deviations seems to be associated with multiple factors, not only regulatory changes. Most of these do not display a uniform importance across currency pairs and time, and some are associated with possibly temporary drivers (such as asynchronous monetary policy cycles).
F31|“Distant or close cousins: Connectedness between cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies volatilities”|This paper examines the volatility interconnection between the main cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies during the period of February 2014-September 2018 using both a framework proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2014) and the modified approach of Antonakakis and Gabauer (2017). Our results suggest that a 34.43%, of the total variance of the forecast errors is explained by shocks across the eight examined cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies, indicating that the remainder 65.57% of the variation is due to idiosyncratic shocks. Furthermore, we find that volatility connectedness varies over time, with a surge during periods of increasing economic and financial instability. When we aggregate both markets by blocks, we find that the block of traditional currencies and the block of cryptocurrencies are mostly disconnected with periods of mild net volatility spill over between both blocks. Finally, our findings suggest that financial market variables are the main drivers of total connectedness within the traditional currencies, while the cryptocurrency-specific variables are identified as the key determinant for the total connectedness within the traditional currencies and a combination of business cycles and cryptocurrency-specific variables explain the directional volatility connectedness between both blocks.
F31|Trade and Worker Deskilling|Abstract This paper presents new evidence on international trade and worker outcomes. It examines a big world event that produced an unprecedentedly large shock to the UK exchange rate. In the 24 hours in June 2016 during which the UK electorate unexpectedly voted to leave the European Union, the value of sterling plummeted. It recorded the biggest depreciation that has occurred in any of the world's four major currencies since the collapse of Bretton Woods. Exploiting this variation, the paper studies the impact of trade on wages and worker training. Wages and training fell for workers employed in sectors where the intermediate import price rose by more as a consequence of the sterling depreciation. Calibrating the estimated wage elasticity with respect to intermediate import prices to theory uncovers evidence of a production complementarity between workers and intermediate imports. This provides new direct evidence that, in the modern world of global value chains, it is changes in the cost of intermediate imports that act as a driver of the impact of globalization on worker welfare. The episode studied and the findings add to widely expressed, growing concerns about poor productivity performance relating to skills and to patterns of real wage stagnation that are plaguing contemporary labour markets.
F31|The Yen Exchange Rate and the Hollowing-out of the Japanese Industry|"Since the demise of the Bretton Woods system, the Yen has seen several episodes of strong appreciation, including in the late 1970s, after the 1985 Plaza Agreement, the early and late 1990s and after 2008. These appreciations have not only been associated with ""expensive Yen recessions"" resulting from negative effects on exports; since the late 1980s, the strong Yen has also raised concerns about a de-industrialisation of the Japanese economy. Against this backdrop, the paper investigates the effects of changes to the Yen exchange rate on the hollowing out of the Japanese industrial sector. To this end, the paper uses both aggregate and industry-specific data to gauge the effects of Yen fluctuations on the output and exports of different Japanese industries, exploiting new data for industry-specific real effective exchange rates. Our findings support the view that the periods of yen appreciation had more than just transitory effects on Japanese manufacturing. The results also provide indication of hysteresis effects on manufacturing. While there are certainly also other factors that have contributed to a hollowing out of Japanese industry, a strong Yen played a role, too."
F31|Discipline or external balance? The choice of international monetary systems in Europe|While there is a huge literature on exchange rate systems since the classical gold standard, less research has been devoted to comparisons of the different arguments that guided the choices. While the origin of the international gold standard in the 1870s was a result of silver coins disappearing from circulation due to rising silver prices, the gold standard has later been interpreted as a quest for monetary discipline. This discipline argument was introduced by the end of WWI as a support for a restoration of the gold standard. Its failure led to an emphasis on the need to avoid external imbalances, which came to the fore in the preparations of the Bretton Woods system. The balance argument was also central in the early discussions of a monetary union in Europe, but with the critique of Keynesianism it was superseded by the disciplinary argument which became determinant for the design of EMU.
F31|Dirty float or clean intervention? The Bank of England in the foreign exchange market|The effectiveness of central bank intervention is debated and despite literature showing mixed results, central banks regularly intervene in the foreign exchange market, both in developing and developed economies. Does foreign exchange intervention work? Using over 60,000 new daily observations on intervention and exchange rates, this paper is the first study of the Bank of England’s foreign exchange intervention between 1952 and 1972. The main finding is that the Bank of England was unsuccessful in managing a credible exchange rate over that period. Running an event study, I demonstrate that betting systematically against the Bank of England would have been a profitable trading strategy. The Bank of England failed to maintain credibility in offshore markets and eventually manipulated the publication of its reserve figures to avoid a run on sterling.
F31|Nominal and Real Effective Exchange Rates for Europe, 1870-2016: Some methodological issues|This paper presents and discusses a new database on nominal and real effective exchange rates for an extensive range of European countries spanning 1870-2016. Indeed, with the exception of a few countries, such long run historical series have not been previously constructed. To gage the validity of these series, comparisons with the BIS and IMF indices are conducted. In addition to stretching further back in time, it is shown that the new indices are more consistent and transparent in construction, even over the recent period. Limitations of the new series, relating to both some underlying data and the index problem are considered. Supplementary to the effective exchange rate indices, is a collection of cost of living or CPI indices 1870-1990, which are based on a critical survey in this paper of those indices which are widely used and abused.
F31|Accumulation of Foreign Currency Reserves and Risk-taking|We assess whether the accumulation of foreign currency reserves in the Asia-Pacific region may have unintended consequences in the form of increased private sector risk-taking. To do so we carry out a country-specific daily data event study analysis of the relationship between official announcements of reserves stocks and various proxy measures of risk-taking. Overall, our results suggest that reserves accumulation exerts no systematic influence on risk-taking.
F31|International Linkages and the Changing Nature of International Business Cycles|We quantify the eﬀects of changes in international input-output linkages on the nature of business cycles. We build a multi-sector multi-country international business cycle model that matches the input-output structure within and across countries. We ﬁnd that, in our 23 countries sample with manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors, changes in the international input-output linkages between 1970 and 2007 causes a 15% drop in output volatility in a median country, but the eﬀects are heterogeneous across countries. Changing international linkages tend to stabilize output in most countries, while leading to a higher risk of a global recession.
F31|A Tale of Two Surplus Countries: China and Germany|We analyze current account imbalances through the lens of the two largest surplus countries; China and Germany. We observe two striking patterns visible since the 2007/8 Global Financial Crisis. First, while China has been gradually reducing its current account surplus, Germany’s surplus has continued to increase throughout and after the crisis. Second, for these two countries, there is a remarkable reversal in the patterns of exchange rate misalignment: China’s currency has turned from being undervalued to overvalued, Germany’s currency has erased its level of overvaluation and become undervalued. Our empirical analyses show that the current account balances of these two countries are quite well explained by currency misalignment, common economic factors, and country-specific factors. Furthermore, we highlight the global financial crisis effects and, for Germany, the importance of differentiating balances against euro and non-euro countries.
F31|A Jackknife Model Averaging Analysis of RMB Misalignment Estimates|We adopt the Jackknife Model Averaging (JMA) technique to conduct a meta-regression analysis of 925 renminbi (RMB) misalignment estimates generated by 69 studies. The JMA method accounts for model selection and sampling uncertainties, and allows for non-nested model specifications and heteroskedasticity in assessing effects of study characteristics. The RMB misalignment estimates are found to be systematically affected by the choices of data, the theoretical setup and the empirical strategy, in addition to publication attributes of these studies. These study characteristic effects are quite robust to the choice of benchmark study characteristics, to alternative model averaging methods including the heteroskedasticity-robust Mallows approach, the information criterion approach, and the Bayesian model averaging. In evaluating the probabilistic property of RMB misalignment estimates implied by hypothetical composites of study characteristics, we find the evidence of a misaligned RMB, in general, is weak.
F31|Real Effective Exchange Rates determinants and growth: lessons from Italian regions|In this paper we analyse the price competitiveness of the Italian regions by computing the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) for each region, deflated by CPI and vis-à-vis the main partner countries. We use them to look for the medium-term determinants, finding significant heterogeneities in the role of government consumption and investment expenditure. Government consumption has an extremely negative effect on competitiveness in North-Eastern Italy, Southern Italy and Lazio. Investment plays a negative role especially in the North-West, while it can be positive for competitiveness in Lazio and Southern Italy. We also find that the transfer theory does not necessarily hold and it even behaves in the opposite direction in case of North-Eastern Italy and Lazio. Lastly, we show that an increase in the regional price competitiveness influences regional growth positively only in the long run and spillovers may play a role.
F31|The Economic Correlation between China and Southeast Asian Countries: derivative market and real sector analysis|This paper attempts to analyse the economic integration of China and Southeast Asian countries. This paper adopts several methods: One, stationarity for correlation, Error Correction Model (ECM) for short-run relation and Cointegration for long-run relationships. Two, Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) analysis to identify the cause and impact. As stock market index follows real sector performance this paper utilizes: One, elasticity analysis of economic growth between China and these countries as a proxy for real sector economic relations between them and two, descriptive statistical analysis on real effective exchange rate as well as Current Account Balance as a proxy of external economic performance between them. In correlation analysis, this paper found that one, stationarity of each country is the difference at level; two, short-run economic relations (ECM) between China and these Southeast Asian countries and three, they have long-run economic relations. In causality, this paper found that China affects all of these Southeast Asian countries and no causality between Singapore and the Philippines. In term of real sector analysis, this paper found that one, economic growth in China significantly affects all of these countries’ economic growth. Two, the external economic performance of these countries are the difference with special finding on Indonesia’s current account.
F31|Exchange rate pass-through to import prices in Europe: A panel cointegration approach|This paper takes a panel cointegration approach to the estimation of short- and long-run exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to import prices in the European countries. Although economic theory suggests a long-run relationship between import prices and exchange rate, in recent empirical studies its existence has either been overlooked, or it has proven dicult to establish. Resorting to novel tests for panel cointegration, we nd support for the equilibrium relationship hypothesis. Exchange rate pass-through elasticities, estimated by two di erent techniques for cointegrated panel regressions, give insight into the most recent development of the ERPT.
F31|Who Is Successful in Foreign Exchange Margin Trading? New Survey Evidence from Japan|We use a 2018 survey of FX margin traders in Japan to investigate which key factors influence their performance: socio-demographic and economic situation, investment strategy and trading behaviour, and/or financial literacy. First, the data show that variables from all three groups are significant predictors of traders’ performance. Second, we find that older traders and those without a specific trading strategy demonstrate lower performance. Performance is higher for those who trade greater amounts, rely more on fundamental analysis, and report having profitable FX trade skills. Third, respondents’ subjectively stated claim of having FX trade skills is based on a more advanced understanding of FX trading and a reliance on professional advice. Neither objective financial knowledge nor over/underconfidence play a noteworthy role in the performance of margin traders.
F31|Towards resolving the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) ‘puzzle’ in Newly Industrialized Countries (NIC’s)|The Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) hypothesis represents one of the oldest existing economic doctrines and is plagued with empirical inconsistencies collectively labelled as ‘puzzles’. Our study resolves these ‘puzzles’ for 14 Newly Industrialized Countries (NIC) whose developmental strategies are impinged on the stability of real exchange rates which, in turn, validates the PPP hypothesis. We test for the stationarity of real exchange rates (RER’s) by applying an exponential smooth transition autoregressive unit root test augmented with a fractional frequency flexible Fourier form component (ESTAR-FFFFF) to capture heterogeneous smooth transition asymmetries and approximate unknown structural breaks in the time series. We find the RER’s in all 14 NIC’s are mean-reverting over monthly period of 1970:1-2018:12 which confirms the PPP hypothesis for these economies in the presence of exchange-rate regime shifts, oil and food shocks, financial crisis and other forms of asymmetries and structural breaks.

F31|Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Returns: Time-Varying Risk Regimes|We develop an empirical model of exchange rate returns, applied separately to samples of developed (DM) and developing (EM) economies’ currencies against the dollar. Monetary policy stance of the global central banks, measured via a natural-language-based approach, has a large effect on exchange rate returns over the ensuing year, is closely linked to the VIX, and becomes increasingly important in the post-crisis era. We document an important spillover effect: monetary policy of the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the ECB is as important as Fed policy in forecasting currency returns against the dollar. In the post-crisis era, a one standard deviation increase in dovishness of all four central banks forecasts a 5.8% (4.0%) one-year excess return of DM (EM) currencies. Furthermore, we find that the relation between a DM country’s interest rate differential relative to the dollar (carry) and the future returns from investing in its currency switches sign from the pre- to the post-crisis subperiod, while for EMs the carry variable is never a significant predictor of returns. The high profit from the carry trade for EM currencies reflects persistent country characteristics likely reflective of risk rather than the interest differential per se. While measures of global monetary policy stance forecast exchange rate returns against the dollar, they do not predict exchange rate returns against other base currencies. Results regarding returns from carry, however, are insensitive to the choice of the base currency. We construct a no-arbitrage pricing model which reconciles many of our empirical findings.
F31|Hoarding for Stormy Days - Test of International Reserves Providing Financial Buffer Services|This paper outlines a tractable cost-benefit analysis of the buffers stock financial services provided by international reserves, and applies it to 8 of the largest Emerging Markets (BRICS, Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey) during 2000Q1-2019Q1. Efficient management of international reserves generates sizable benefits for countries characterized by hard-currency external debt. These benefits increase with the volatility of the real exchange rates and sovereign spreads. Counter-cyclical management of hoarding reserves in good times and selling them in bad times provides buffers stock financial services adding up to about 3% of GDP during our sample period.
F31|The Currency Composition of International Reserves, Demand for International Reserves, and Global Safe Assets|This paper examines determinants of the international reserves (IR) currency composition before and after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Applying the annual data of 58 countries, we confirm that countries that trade more with the US, euro zone, UK, and Japan, and issue more debt denominated in the big four currencies (US dollar, euro, pound, yen) hoard more IR in these currencies. We find scale effects in which countries tend to diversify from the big four currencies as they increase their IR/GDP and that a growing shortage of global safe assets (GSAs) induces countries to hold more big four currencies. Countries hold less big four currencies as IR after the 2008 GFC, while they hold more of such currencies since the tapering of the Fed’s quantitative easing. The 2008 GFC and QE tapering weakened and sometimes reversed the effect of several economic factors. We also find that TARGET2 balances matter for the currency composition in the euro zone; commodity-exporting countries tend to diversify their IR from the big four currencies when their terms of trade improve; and that the valuation effects induced by Euro/USD exchange rate changes diminish the significance of the GFC in explaining the currency composition of IR.
F31|Inflation and Exchange Rate Targeting Challenges Under Fiscal Dominance|Countries have increased significantly their public-sector borrowing since the Global Financial Crisis. In this context, we document several potential fiscal dominance effects during 2000-2017 under Inflation Targeting (IT), and non IT regimes. Higher ratios of public debt-to-GDP are associated with lower policy interest rates in Advanced Economies. In Emerging Market economies under non-IT regimes, composed mostly of exchange rate targeters, the interest rate effect of higher public debt is non-linear, and depends both on the ratio of foreign-currency to total public debt, and on the ratio of hard-currency debt to GDP. For these Emerging Market economies under non-IT regimes, real exchange rate depreciations and international reserves accumulation are significantly associated with higher interest rates. Sorting countries into low, medium and high nominal exchange rate volatility bins, we find that the high nominal exchange rate volatility group of Emerging Market economies, composed mostly of commodity intensive countries, show the most persuasive evidence of debt levels influencing policy interest rates.
F31|Are Intermediary Constraints Priced?|Violations of no-arbitrage conditions measure the shadow cost of constraints on intermediaries, and the risk that these constraints tighten is priced. We demonstrate in an intermediary-based asset pricing model that violations of no-arbitrage such as covered interest rate parity (CIP) violations, along with intermediary wealth returns, can be used to price assets. We describe a “forward CIP trading strategy” that bets on CIP violations becoming smaller, and show that its returns help identify the price of the risk that the shadow cost of intermediary constraints increases. This risk contributes substantially to the volatility of the stochastic discount factor, and appears to be priced consistently in U.S. treasury, emerging market sovereign bond, and foreign exchange portfolios.
F31|Exchange Rate Reconnect|"The failure to find fundamentals that co-move with exchange rates or forecasting models with even mild predictive power â?? facts broadly referred to as ""exchange rate disconnect"" â?? stands among the most disappointing, but robust, facts in all of international macroeconomics. In this paper, we demonstrate that U.S. purchases of foreign bonds, which did not co-move with exchange rates prior to 2007, have provided significant in-sample, and even some out-of-sample, explanatory power for currencies since then. We show that several proxies for global risk factors also start to co-move strongly with the dollar and with U.S. purchases of foreign bonds around 2007, suggesting that risk plays a key role in this finding. We use security-level data on U.S. portfolios to demonstrate that the reconnect of U.S. foreign bond purchases to exchange rates is largely driven by investment in dollar-denominated assets rather than by foreign currency exposure alone. Our results support the narrative emerging from an active recent literature that the US dollar's role as an international and safe-haven currency has surged since the global financial crisis."
F31|Change of Monetary Regime, Contracts, and Prices: Lessons from the Great Depression, 1932-1935|In this paper I analyze the process leading to the abandonment of the gold standard in the U.S. in1933, and the devaluation of the dollar in 1934. I argue that most changes of monetary regime have an impact on contracts. In this specific case, contracts that were written in terms of gold, or “gold equivalent,” were rewritten in paper dollars. Congress did this on June 5 1933, when it abrogated the “gold clause” retroactively. The Supreme Court validated the move in February 1935. The result was a very large transfer of wealth from creditors to debtors. I use daily data on commodity prices to investigate the extent to which these policies contributed to ending deflation. I find that commodity prices reacted strongly to the announcement of policy changes, and to legal procedures involving contracts. These results are consistent with the “change in regime” hypothesis of Sargent.
F31|Covered Interest Parity deviations: Macrofinancial determinants|For several decades until the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), Covered Interest Parity (CIP) appeared to hold quite closely-even as a broad macroeconomic relationship applying to daily or weekly data. Not only have CIP deviations significantly increased since the GFC, but potential macrofinancial drivers of the variation in CIP deviations have also become significant. The variation in CIP deviations seems to be associated with multiple factors, not only regulatory changes. Most of these do not display a uniform importance across currency pairs and time, and some are associated with possibly temporary drivers (such as asynchronous monetary policy cycles).
F31|Cryptocurrencies, Currency Competition, and the Impossible Trinity|We analyze a two-country economy with complete markets, featuring two national currencies as well as a global (crypto)currency. If the global currency is used in both countries, the national nominal interest rates must be equal and the exchange rate between the national currencies is a risk- adjusted martingale. We call this result Crypto-Enforced Monetary Policy Synchronization (CEMPS). Deviating from interest equality risks approaching the zero lower bound or the abandonment of the national currency. If the global currency is backed by interest-bearing assets, additional and tight restrictions on monetary policy arise. Thus, the classic Impossible Trinity becomes even less reconcilable.
F31|A Macroprudential Theory of Foreign Reserve Accumulation|This paper proposes a theory of foreign reserves as macroprudential policy. We study an open economy model of financial crises, in which pecuniary externalities lead to over-borrowing, and show that by accumulating international reserves, the government can achieve the constrained-efficient allocation. The optimal reserve accumulation policy leans against the wind and significantly reduces the exposure to financial crises. The theory is consistent with the joint dynamics of private and official capital flows, both over time and in the cross section, and can quantitatively account for the recent upward trend in international reserves.
F31|Puzzling Exchange Rate Dynamics and Delayed Portfolio Adjustment|This objective of this paper is to show that the proposal by Froot and Thaler (2000) of delayed portfolio adjustment can account for a broad set of puzzles about the relationship between interest rates and exchange rates. The puzzles include: i) the delayed overshooting puzzle; ii) the forward discount puzzle (or Fama puzzle); iii) the predictability reversal puzzle; iv) the Engel puzzle (high interest rate currencies are stronger than implied by UIP); v) the forward guidance exchange rate puzzle; vi) the absence of a forward discount puzzle with long-term bonds. These results are derived analytically in a simple two-country model with portfolio adjustment costs. Quantitatively, this approach can match all the moments related to these puzzles.
F31|Business Cycles and Currency Returns|We find a strong link between currency excess returns and the relative strength of the business cycle. Buying currencies of strong economies and selling currencies of weak economies generates high returns both in the cross section and time series of countries. These returns stem primarily from spot exchange rate predictability, are uncorrelated with common currency investment strategies, and cannot be understood using traditional currency risk factors in either unconditional or conditional asset pricing tests. We also show that a business cycle factor implied by our results is priced in a broad currency cross section.
F31|A Liquidity-Based Resolution of the Uncovered Interest Parity Puzzle|A new monetary theory is set out to resolve the â€œUncovered Interest Parity (UIP)â€ Puzzle. It explores the possibility that liquidity properties of money and nominal bonds can account for the puzzle. A key concept in our model is that nominal bonds carry liquidity premia. We show that the UIP can fail to hold under the economic environment where collateral pledgeability and/or liquidity of nominal bonds and/or collateralized credit based transactions are relatively bigger. Our liquidity based theory can help understanding many empirical observations that risk based explanations find difficult to reconcile with.
F31|Out-of-Sample Analysis of International Reserves for Emerging Economies with a Dynamic Panel Model|Using data on 70 emerging countries for 1990-2011, we re-examine the validity of both traditional and recently proposed determinants of international reserves. The dynamic panel model considers panel unit root, endogeneity, and country heterogeneity and reveals that not only traditional determinants but also new financial variablesâ€”M2/GDP and foreign capital inflows through over-the-counter marketsâ€” have significant effects on reserves hoarding. More importantly, out-of-sample forecasts show that the dynamic model yields the best goodness-of-fit, and its predicted values successfully account for the recent patterns in reserve accumulations.
F31|Covered interest rate parity, relative funding liquidity and cross-currency repos|Deviations from the covered interest rate parity (CIP) are considerably smaller or even zero when calculated based on a particular set of repo rates, so-called cross-currency repo rates, instead of standard interest rates, such as overnight indexed swap or Interbank Offered rates. We attribute this (partial) solution of the CIP puzzle to the nearly identical risk characteristics of foreign exchange swaps and cross-currency repos: both are virtually devoid of counterparty credit risk but incorporate a relative funding liquidity premium. In practice, CIP deviations can thus be exploited on a truly riskless basis using cross-currency repo transactions, which is not the case for other interest rates.
F31|Estimating the Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Total Exports|This paper shows that real effective exchange rate (REER) regressions, the standard approach for estimating the response of aggregate exports to exchange rate changes, imply biased estimates of the underlying elasticities. We provide a new aggregate regression specification that is consistent with bilateral trade flows micro-founded by the gravity equation. This theory-consistent aggregation leads to unbiased estimates when prices are set in an international currency as postulated by the dominant currency paradigm. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to compare elasticity estimates based on this new “ideal-REER” regression against typical regression specifications found in the REER literature. The results show that the biases are small (around 1 percent) for the exchange rate and large (around 10 percent) for the demand elasticity. We find empirical support for this prediction from annual trade flow data. The difference between elasticities estimated on the bilateral and aggregate levels reduces significantly when applying an ideal-REER regression rather than a standard REER approach.
F31|Exports, Imported Inputs, and Domestic Supply Networks|Exporters have large domestic supply networks. We examine the impact of import reliance within their domestic supply networks on exchange rate pass-through to export prices and volume. For identification, we use administrative firm-to-firm sales and firm-product-destination level customs databases from a large emerging market, Turkey. We find that (i) while exporters' degree of reliance on imported goods is 24\%, this number reaches nearly 45\% once their suppliers are taken into account; (ii) following a domestic currency depreciation, exporters that use imported inputs more or those working with import-intensive suppliers raise their producer-currency export prices significantly more and increase their export volumes significantly less; (iii) exporters with higher reliance on a single supplier have higher exchange rate pass-through to export prices; and (iv) exporters with higher overall import intensity experience greater disruption in their supply networks, e.g., they establish fewer new supplier linkages and terminate more of their existing linkages, following a domestic currency depreciation.
F31|Estimates of Exchange Rate Pass-through with Product-level Data|We estimate the export and import pass-through rates using product-level data from Turkey. We find that the Turkish lira (TRY) exchange rate changes are mostly passed on to TRY prices of exports and imports–and therefore modestly to their prices in trading partners’ currencies. The rate of average pass-through to TRY-prices is 89% for imported goods and 82% for exported goods, with no apparent lags in the impact. Pass-through estimates by sector show variation and are relatively low for food and agricultural products. We argue that the highly-detailed productlevel data enable us to estimate the pass-through rates with better reliability and precision than we could by using only aggregated time-series data. We also introduce a pooled equation to estimate the difference between the export and import pass-through rates–a potentially useful statistic–in a way that allows statistical inference.
F31|Foreign Currency Debt and the Exchange Rate Pass-Through|We show that higher foreign currency indebtedness raises the degree of exchange rate pass-through to domestic producer prices. For identification, we use micro-level data from Turkey, an emerging market economy that has experienced large exchange rate movements over the last decade. Matching the Credit Register of Turkey with disaggregated manufacturing sector data on domestic prices and foreign currency revenues from international trade, we show that sectors with higher ex-ante net foreign-currency liabilities raise their prices significantly more following domestic currency depreciation. The results are stronger if foreign currency liabilities are short term.
F31|Revisiting external imbalances: Insights from sectoral accounts|This paper revisits the period of substantial widening of external imbalances in advanced economies in the run-up to the global financial crisis and their adjustment since then. We take a granular look at these imbalances through the lens of their domestic counterpart: the net financial balance of the household sector, the government, non-financial corporations, and financial corporations. Our findings challenge the often-claimed view that the household sector lies behind most of the dynamics of the current account. In fact, we show that it is non-financial corporations and the government that account for the bulk of: (i) the co-movement with the standard set of fundamental covariates of the current account; (ii) the external adjustment and expenditure reduction in the aftermath of the global financial crisis; and (iii) the diverging dynamics during large and persistent current account imbalances. These results emphasize that analyzing domestic sectoral balances can lead to a better empirical and theoretical understanding of global imbalances.
F31|Multiple banking relationships: the role of firm connectedness|The aim of this work is to shed light on the role that firm connectedness has on multiple bank relationships, controlling for other firm-level traditional determinants. Working on a large sample of Italian manufacturing firms, we develop novel measures of firm connectedness and multiple banking. We measure firm connectedness by exploiting the information on the number of connections that a non-financial firm has with any other non-financial firm through persons holding a position (including several types of appointments such as shareholder, administrator, technical or administrative worker, among others) in both companies. The paper finds empiri- cal evidence showing that firm connectedness is positively associated with the number of banks that provide credits to the firm. This eâ†µect appears to be stronger for the younger, smaller and more indebted firms, thereby suggesting that firmsâ€™ connectedness favours their access to multiple sources of credit by reducing the negotiation and transaction costs that these compa- nies face to engage with lending banks, due to asymmetric information. Connectedness does not seem to reduce the incentives for the firms to expand the number of lenders to minimize hold-up risks.
F31|The Law of One Food Price|Are food prices more or less equalised across countries? In view of obvious barriers to trade (both naturally occurring and of a man-made nature) and currency gyrations, the answer would seem to be an unambiguous “No”, but we show this question is worthy of further investigation. In order for the law of one price (LOP) to hold, domestic prices must respond one-for-one to changes in world prices and exchange rates, but this is usually prevented by variations in mark-ups and/or trade barriers. We use data on consumer prices from the International Comparison Program and producer prices from the Food and Agriculture Organization to test for the LOP for food. While not completely conclusive, these tests show the various market wedges appear to be insufficiently important to prevent food prices to equalise over the longer term.
F31|What is the Impact of Monetary Policy on Wealth Inequality?|We construct a global panel data set to examine the relationship between monetary policy and wealth inequality. Dynamic panel estimates suggest that both overall and inherited wealth inequality increase with growth in the base money supply. These results hold for countries with at least one billionaire and for OECD countries. Interest rates have an insigni cant distributional impact overall, but this relationship becomes signi cant in a sample of OECD countries.
F31|Modelling and forecasting the dollar-pound exchange rate in the presence of structural breaks|We employ a newly-developed partial cointegration system allowing for level shifts to examine whether economic fundamentals form the long-run determinants of the dollar-pound exchange rate in an era of structural change. The paper uncovers a class of local data generation mechanisms underlying long-run and short-run dynamic features of the exchange rate using a set of economic variables that explicitly reï¬‚ect the central banksâ€™ monetary policy stances and the inï¬‚uence of a forward exchange market. The impact of the Brexit referendum is evaluated by examining forecasts when the dollar-pound exchange rate fell substantially around the vote.
F31|Connectedness between G10 currencies: Searching for the causal structure|This paper presents a new approach for modelling the connectedness between asset returns. We adapt the measure of Diebold and Y¸lmaz (2014), which is based on the forecast error variance decomposition of a VAR model. However, their connectedness measure hinges on critical assumptions with regard to the variance-covariance matrix of the error terms. We propose to use a more agnostic empirical approach, based on a machine learning algorithm, to identify the contemporaneous structure. In a Monte Carlo study we compare the different connectedness measures and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In an empirical application we analyse the connectedness between the G10 currencies. Our results suggest that the US dollar as well as the Norwegian krone are the most independent currencies in our sample. By contrast, the Swiss franc and New Zealand dollar have a negligible impact on other currencies. Moreover, a cluster analysis suggests that the currencies can be divided into three groups, which we classify as: commodity currencies, European currencies and safe haven/carry trade financing currencies.
F31|Equilibrium real exchange rate estimates across time and space|Equilibrium real exchange rate and corresponding misalignment estimates differ tremendously depending on the panel estimation method used to derive them. Essentially, these methods differ in their treatment of the time-series (time) and the cross-section (space) variation in the panel. The study shows that conventional panel estimation methods (pooled OLS, fixed, random, and between effects) can be interpreted as restricted versions of a correlated random effects (CRE) model. It formally derives the distortion that arises if these restrictions are violated and uses two empirical applications from the literature to show that the distortion is generally very large. This suggests the use of the CRE model for the panel estimation of equilibrium real exchange rates and misalignments.
F31|The Yen Exchange Rate and the Hollowing Out of the Japanese Industry|Since the demise of the Bretton Woods system, the yen has seen several episodes of strong appreciation, including in the late 1970s, after the 1985 Plaza Agreement, the early and late 1990s and after 2008. These appreciations have not only been associated with “expensive yen recessions” resulting from negative effects on exports; since the late 1980s, the strong yen has also raised concerns about a de-industrialisation of the Japanese economy. Against this backdrop, the paper investigates the effects of changes to the yen exchange rate on the hollowing out of the Japanese industrial sector. To this end, the paper uses both aggregate and industry-specific data to gauge the effects of yen fluctuations on the output and exports of different Japanese industries, exploiting new data for industry-specific real effective exchange rates. Our findings support the view that the periods of yen appreciation had more than just transitory effects on Japanese manufacturing. The results also provide indication of hysteresis effects on manufacturing. While there are certainly also other factors that have contributed to a hollowing out of Japanese industry, a strong yen played a role, too.
F31|The portfolio theory of inflation (and policy effectiveness)|"The Portfolio Theory of Inflation (PIT) proposed in this study investigates the role of global financial markets in determining the effectiveness of macroeconomic policy in open and fully financial integrated economies. The PIT adopts a modified version of the portfolio balance approach to exchange rate determination and incorporates intertemporal optimal choices from global investors. These investors allocate resources across national economies based on local investment opportunities and policy credibility: when a country's credibility is low, they hold its economy to a tighter intertemporal budget constraint and the issuance of what they deem as ""excess"" public sector liabilities causes the country's currency to depreciate and inflation to rise due to a large exchange rate pass-through, with limited or no impact on output. On the other hand, high credibility creates space for effective and noninflationary macro policies but, if such space is abused, credibility gets dissipated and higher inflation reflects such dissipation."
F31|Do Remittances Worsen Export Diversification?|The paper explores the impact of workersâ€™ remittances on the level of export diversification. The hypothesis is that significant inflow of remittances causes overvaluation of real exchange rate, which in turn deteriorates diversity of export. The theoretical base is in line with the Dutch disease phenomenon. The paper uses annual cross-national panel data over 2000-2016 period and System GMM methodology. The evidence suggests that indeed large inflow of remittances is associated with less diversified export. The economic intuition behind is that remittance-caused real exchange rate appreciation unevenly suppresses export of goods: some goods â€œsufferâ€ more than others do. In terms of the number of product-names, a percentage point increase in remittances to GDP sent home â€œreducesâ€ variety of export by approximately five active lines. There are other interesting findings as well. An improvement of government effectiveness facilitates overall export diversification; terms of trade improvement and rise of real exchange rate volatility mostly increase export concentration rather than alter number of exported product-names.
F31|Exportweltmeister: The low returns on Germany's capital exports|"Germany is world champion in exporting capital (""Exportweltmeister""). No other country invests larger amounts of savings outside its borders. However, Germany plays in the third division when it comes to investment performance, as we show in this paper. We study the returns on German foreign investments from 1950 to 2017 and find that: (1) Germany's annual returns on foreign assets were 2 to 5 percentage points lower than those of comparable countries. Germany ranks last among the G7 countries, also in the last decade; (2) Domestic returns on German assets have outperformed foreign returns abroad by about 3 percentage points per year; (3) Germany's external wealth provides very little consumption insurance as foreign returns are highly correlated with domestic activity; (4) The capital exports do little to diversify demographic risks as Germany mainly invests in countries with similar demographics. Taken together, these facts raise substantial doubts whether German households, firms, and banks allocate their savings in a beneficial way."
F31|Knapp's 'State Theory of Money' and its reception in German academic discourse|"In 1905, Georg Friedrich Knapp published The State Theory of Money in his native German, claiming that money is a ""creature of law"" and not connected to metals via some intrinsic value. When the English translation appeared in 1924, apparently at the wishes of John Maynard Keynes, the German version had run through four editions, upon which the last the translation builds. There also had been considerable debate about ""Chartalism"" - the idea that money derived its acceptance by legal means - in the German academic literature. Among others, Knut Wicksell and Georg Simmel commented on it. Since so far there has not been any English-language publication on this issue, it is deemed worthwhile to provide such. After presenting the main arguments that Knapp makes in his book, the academic reviews that followed are presented and evaluated."
F31|The making of Turkey's 2018-2019 economic crisis|Turkish economic growth depends on capital inflows and access to cheap credit sources. Once the global financial conditions tightened in 2018, Turkey was among the emerging markets that suffered the most. This article analyses the making of Turkey's economic crisis in 2018-2019, while elaborating the phases of Turkish financialisation. It locates the slow-motion drift of Turkish economy within the context of dependent financialisation and argues that a long-term account is needed to grasp the economic turmoil of recent years.
F31|The Two-Pillar Policy for the RMB|"We document stylized facts about China's recent exchange rate policy for its currency, the renminbi (RMB). Our empirical findings suggest that a ""two-pillar policy"" is in place, aiming to balance RMB index stability and exchange rate flexibility. We then develop a tractable no-arbitrage model of the RMB under the two-pillar policy. Using derivatives data on the RMB and the U.S. dollar index, we estimate the model to assess financial markets' views about the fundamental exchange rate and sustainability of the policy. Our model is able to predict the modification of the two-pillar policy in May 2017, when a discretion-based ""countercyclical factor"" was introduced for the first time. We also examine the model's ability to forecast RMB movements."
F31|"Beyond the doomsday economics of ""proof-of-work"" in cryptocurrencies"|"This paper discusses the economics of how Bitcoin achieves data immutability, and thus payment finality, via costly computations, ie ""proof-of-work"". Further, it explores what the future might hold for cryptocurrencies modelled on this type of consensus algorithm. The conclusions are, first, that Bitcoin counterfeiting via ""double-spending"" attacks is inherently profitable, making payment finality based on proof-of-work extremely expensive. Second, the transaction market cannot generate an adequate level of ""mining"" income via fees as users free-ride on the fees of other transactions in a block and in the subsequent blockchain. Instead, newly minted bitcoins, known as block rewards, have made up the bulk of mining income to date. Looking ahead, these two limitations imply that liquidity is set to fall dramatically as these block rewards are phased out. Simple calculations suggest that once block rewards are zero, it could take months before a Bitcoin payment is final, unless new technologies are deployed to speed up payment finality. Second-layer solutions such as the Lightning Network might help, but the only fundamental remedy would be to depart from proof-of-work, which would probably require some form of social coordination or institutionalisation."

F31|Using Brexit to Identify the Nature of Price Rigidities|Using price quote data that underpin the official U.K. consumer price index (CPI), we analyze the effects of the unexpected passing of the Brexit referendum to the dynamics of price adjustments. The sizable depreciation of the British pound that immediately followed Brexit works as a quasi-experiment, enabling us to study the transmission of a large common marginal cost shock to inflation as well as the distribution of prices within granular product categories. A large portion of the inflationary effect is attributable to the size of price adjustments, implying that a time-dependent price-setting model can match the response of aggregate inflation reasonably well. The state-dependent model fares better in capturing the endogenous selection of price changes at the lower end of the price distribution, however, it misses on the magnitude of the adjustment conditional on selection.
F31|The Global Factor in Neutral Policy Rates : Some Implications for Exchange Rates, Monetary Policy, and Policy Coordination|This paper highlights some of the theoretical and practical implications for monetary policy and exchange rates that derive specifically from the presence of a global general equilibrium factor embedded in neutral real policy rates in open economies. Using a standard two country DSGE model, we derive a structural decomposition in which the nominal exchange rate is a function of the expected present value of future neutral real interest rate differentials plus a business cycle factor and a PPP factor. Country specific “r*” shocks in general require optimal monetary policy to pass these through to the policy rate, but such shocks will also have exchange rate implications, with an expected decline in the path of the real neutral policy rate reflected in a depreciation of the nominal exchange rate. We document a novel empirical regularity between the equilibrium error in the VECM representation of the empirical Holston Laubach Williams (2017) four country r* model and the value of the nominal trade weighted dollar. In fact, the correlation between the dollar and the 12 quarter lag of the HLW equilibrium error is estimated to be 0.7. Global shocks to r* under optimal policy require no exchange rate adjustment because passing though r* shocks to policy rates ‘does all the work’ of maintaining global equilibrium. We also study a richer model with international spill overs so that in theory there can be gains to international policy cooperation. In this richer model we obtain a similar decomposition for the nominal exchange rate, but with the added feature that r* in each country is a function global productivity and business cycle factors even if these factors are themselves independent across countries. We argue that in practice, there could well be significant costs to central bank communication and credibility under a regime of formal policy cooperation, but that gains to policy coordination could be substantial given that r*’s are unobserved but are correlated across countries.
F31|Institutional Investors, the Dollar, and U.S. Credit Conditions|This paper documents that an appreciation of the U.S. dollar is associated with a reduction in the supply of commercial and industrial loans by U.S. banks. An increase in the broad dollar index by 2.5 points (one standard deviation) reduces U.S. banks' corporate loan originations by 10 percent. This decline is driven by a reduction in the demand for loans on the secondary market where prices fall and liquidity worsens when the dollar appreciates, with stronger effects for riskier loans. Today, the main buyers of U.S. corporate loans---and, hence, suppliers of funding for these loans---are institutional investors, in particular mutual funds, which experience outflows when the dollar appreciates. A shift of traditional financial intermediation to these relatively unregulated entities, which are more sensitive to global developments, has led to the emergence of this new channel through which the dollar affects the U.S. economy, which we term the secondary market channel.
F31|Real Exchange Rates and Primary Commodity Prices|In this paper, we show that a substantial fraction of the volatility of real exchange rates between developed economies such as Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom against the US dollar can be accounted for by shocks that affect the prices of primary commodities such as oil, aluminum, maize, or copper. Our analysis implies that existing models used to analyze real exchange rates between large economies that mostly focus on trade between differentiated ﬁnal goods could benefit, in terms of matching the behavior of real exchange rates, by also considering trade in primary commodities.
F31|A Model of Market Making with Heterogeneous Speculators|I introduce an optimizing monopolistic market maker in an otherwise standard setting a la Brock and Hommes (1998) (BH98). The market maker manages her inventory of a zero yielding asset, such as foreign currency, and can earn profits from trading, taking advantage of her knowledge of speculators' demand. The resulting dynamic behavior is qualitatively identical to the one described in BH98, showing that the results of the latter are independent from the institutional framework of the market. At the same time I show that the market maker has conflicting effects. She acts as a stabilizer when she allows for market imbalances, while she acts as a destabilizer when she manages aggressively her inventories and when she trades actively, both if she acts as fundamentalist or if she is a strong extrapolator. Indeed the more stable institutional framework is one in which market makers are inventory neutral and don't trade actively but, even in this case, the typical complex behavior of BH98 occurs.
F31|Estimating monetary policy rules in small open economies|This paper presents an approach for empirically estimating long-run monetary policy rules in small open economies. The approach utilizes the cointegrated VAR methodology and statistical tests on long- and short-run relations, and investigates policy responses. An application is presented for the case of Trinidad and Tobago. The analysis reveals an empirically supported long-run monetary policy rule for the nominal exchange rate, and provides empirical evidence that oil price shocks are transmitted through the TT economy in part via the effects on US prices. Dynamic specification of the nominal exchange rate reveals significant adjustment towards the target equilibrium level, and significant effects from foreign and domestic variables save for the exchange rate. Forecast analysis reveals the significance of oil-price forecasts, and forecast-errors, on monetary policy. The parsimonious model and its parameter estimates are empirically constant and generate reliable forecasts that provide important implications for using estimated policy rules.
F31|Inflation targeting and the forward bias puzzle in emerging countries|Based on quarterly data on 31 emerging countries (among which 16 are inflation targeting countries) from 1990Q1 to 2014Q3, we obtain a strong support for the conjecture that the implementation of inflation targeting weakens the Fisherian relation between expected depreciation and the interest rate differential (uncovered interest parity condition) and thus is conducive to the appearance of the forward bias puzzle in emerging countries. We show that this reflects the performance of inflation targeting regimes in lowering the level and volatility of inflation. Our finding holds when controlling for country-specific effects, time-specific effects, global disinflation, exchange rate management, crises, and using different econometric techniques.
F31|Contagion and bond pricing: The case of the ASEAN region|In this paper, we obtain explicit numerical formulas to price the defaultable bonds prices of firms. The possible default event of the firms happen in random time and not necessary in uniform time spread. For this purpose, we develop a Markov regime-switching Copula model that allows us to well-capture the economic behavior in some ASEAN region countries. The first regime represents the evidence that is used to support the standard economy. The second regime represents the crisis state. Based on various specifications, we obtain an explicit formula to evaluate the conditional Laplace transform of a regime switching Cox Ingersoll Ross model using the semi-affine property of this model. Our numerical results show strong evidence for increasing volatility parameter in crisis state, suggesting more possibility of contagion. Furthermore, statistically significant differences in terms of volatility of default across countries are reported. Indonesia and Malaysia exhibit particularly higher volatility than other markets, especially in the crisis state.
F31|Non-linear relationship between real commodity price volatility and real effective exchange rate: The case of commodity-exporting countries|The aim of this paper is to contribute to the existing literature by exploring the relationship between the real commodity price volatilities and the real effective exchange rate (REER) of commodity-exporting countries, taking into account the transition variable of financial market integration. To this end, we consider a sample of 42 commodity-exporting countries subdivided into 4 panels: food and beverages, energy, metals, and raw materials. Our results highlight that the relationship between real commodity price volatility and REER is non-linear and depends on the degree of financialization of the commodity market. Specifically, when a country is poorly integrated financially, the volatility of the real commodity price has a strong and negative impact on the variation in REER. However, for periods when a country is better integrated financially, we observe a decrease in the impact of real commodity price volatility on REER, especially for the two panels of food and beverages as well as energy. Our findings also highlight the growth of financialization of commodities post-2000, particularly in the case of the energy sector.
F31|Classifying de facto exchange rate regimes of financially open and closed economies: A statistical approach|This paper offers a new de facto exchange rate regime classification that draws on the strengths of three popular classifications. Its two hallmarks are the careful treatment of a nexus between exchange rate regime and financial openness and the use of formal statistical tools (the trimmed k-means and k-nearest neighbour methods). It is demonstrated that our strategy minimises the impact of differences between market-determined and official exchange rates on the ‘fix’ and ‘float’ categories. Moreover, it is more suited to assess empirical relevance of the Mundellian trilemma and ‘irreconcilable duo’ hypotheses. Using comparative analysis we find that the degree of agreement between classifications is moderate: the null of no association is strongly rejected, but its strength ranges from low to moderate. Moreover, it is shown that our classification is the most strongly associated with each of the other classifications and as such can be considered (closest to) a centre of a space of alternative classifications. Finally, we demonstrate that unlike other classifications, ours lends more support to the Mundellian trilemma than to the ‘irreconcilable duo’ hypothesis. Overall, our classification cannot be considered a variant of any other de facto classification. It is a genuinely new classification.
F31|Exchange Rate vs Foreign Price Pass-through: Evidence from the European Gasoline Market|We show that European retail gasoline prices respond slower to changes in the dollar exchange rate than to changes in the international spot price of wholesale gasoline, which is quoted in dollars. This differential passthrough is not specific to the Euro, and is observed both for Euro-member states and also for those using national currencies. We examine the possibility that this pattern is driven by differences in either the variability and or persistence of exchange rates changes relative to those of the dollar price of gasoline, but find minimal supporting evidence for either. Refinery supply contracts treat changes in the dollar price and the exchange rate symmetrically, and are thus also an unlikely explanation. Other possibilities, such pricing to the market or pricing based on the country of origin are precluded by the nature of the product. There is evidence, however, that exchange rate fluctuations are more strongly correlated with country-specific economic conditions, which reduces the ability of firms to pass-through price increases and lessens their incentive to pass-through price decreases. Moreover, consumers likely draw a more direct link between the crude oil and retail gasoline prices, affecting their price expectations and search intensity, and optimal passthrough.
F31|Do Fixers Perform Worse than Non-Fixers during Global Recessions and Recoveries?|There is an important debate about how economies with different exchange rate regimes performed during the Great Recession and its ensuing recovery. While economic theory suggests that economies with fixed exchange rates are more affected and recover more slowly from global shocks than economies with non-fixed exchange rates, the empirical evidence on the most recent global recession has been mixed. This paper examines the exchange rate and economic growth nexus and assesses how this relationship is affected by the four global recessions and recoveries the world economy has experienced post-Bretton Woods. While there is no robust long-term relationship between exchange rate regimes and growth, there is evidence that fixers recover from global recessions at a weaker pace than non-fixers.
F31|Assessing the Macroeconomic Impact of the ECB’s Asset Purchase Programme in a Dynamic Nelson–Siegel Modelling Framework|This paper examines the macroeconomic impact of the Asset Purchase Programme (APP) in the euro area on the basis of a set of macro-ﬁnance variables included in a Dynamic Nelson–Siegel modelling framework. The empirical results emphasise the role of the APP’s portfolio balance channel in stimulating economic growth and inﬂation, both at the aggregate euro area level and at the disaggregated country-speciﬁc level. The portfolio balance channel works at the aggregated level through greater international price competitiveness, easier conditions on capital markets, and higher asset prices. Moreover, the results suggest that the initial APP announcement has increased the annual real GDP growth rates and HICP inﬂation in the euro area by up to 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. At the disaggregated level, there is evidence for the stimulation of bank lending through the portfolio balance channel in the core countries. Moreover, the stronger rise in stock prices in the core countries shows that the wealth effect triggered by portfolio rebalancing is mainly concentrated in the richer member countries. A comparison of the country-speciﬁc macroeconomic impact of APP shows that while overall GDP responses are broadly comparable across countries, the peripheral countries that have implemented effective labour market reforms have beneﬁted signiﬁcantly from bond purchases in stimulating inﬂation. This points to the need for further labour market reforms in Italy. A reform package of labour and product market reforms can help to reduce the resulting transition costs.
F31|What nexus exists between exchange rate and trade balance? The case of Nigeria vis-à-vis UK, US and Hong Kong|The role of exchange rate movements in determining the trading position of a country and the ultimate welfare of its people vis-à-vis its trading partners is enormous. Consequently, this study is conducted to examine the nature of the trading relationship between Nigeria and its trading partners in three continents-North America, Europe and Asia. The study specifically focuses on how the fluctuation of naira vis-à-vis the pound sterling, dollar and Yuan affects Nigeria's trading position in relation to UK, US and Hong Kong (China). Quarterly data that span the period from 1981 to 2015 were used and linear and Non-linear ARDL estimation techniques were deployed to prove the existence of linear and nonlinear J-Curve. The findings, based on linear ARDL, show no proof of J-Curve in all the models, however, cointegration exists between the trade balance and the exchange rate dynamics. In non-linear ARDL, the existence of J-Curve is only observed in Nigeria-Hong Kong model. However, the findings show that there is both the existence of cointegration and the short-run and the long-run asymmetric nexus between exchange rate dynamics and trade balance in all the models. The overarching implication of the finding is that devaluation of Naira will not improve Nigeria’s trading position vis-à-vis trading partners considered.
F31|Inflation targeting and the pass-through effect: The case of Mongolia|This paper aims to provide empirical evidence on the relationship between inflation targeting and the pass-through effect from exchange rate to consumer prices, focusing on the case of Mongolia. The study estimates a vector-autoregressive model, and examines the impulse responses of consumer prices to the shock of exchange rate for the pre-inflation targeting period and the post-inflation targeting period. The empirical analysis identified the existence of the pass-through effect during the pre-inflation targeting period and the loss of the pass-through during the post-inflation targeting period. It was speculated that the loss of the pass-through comes from the “forward-looking” monetary policy rule in Mongolian inflation targeting, so that it can work on the expectations of domestic agents such that they are less inclined to change prices in response to a given exchange rate shock.
F31|Macroeconomic Shocks and Trade Balance Adjustments in Papua New Guinea|Previous studies have mostly focused on the relationship between macroeconomic shocks and trade balance adjustments of resource-rich countries while largely overlooked countries with trade composition of high resource-export and strong import-dependence such as Papua New Guinea. Utilising a Bayesian Vector Autoregressive (BVAR) model, we quantify the relative importance of macroeconomic shocks on the country's trade balance adjustments and examine how they evolve over time. Our identification strategy takes advantage of the fact that shocks generated from the resource sector and non-resource sector would have heterogeneous impacts on trade activity. We document that at a different point in time, all identified shocks except inflation contributed significantly to the fluctuations in trade balance with varying magnitude. The impulse responses show that one standard deviation of devaluation in the real exchange rate and resource boom lead to an immediate improvement in the trade balance. Shocks in the non-resource sector and inflation are found to have a positive impact on the trade balance, but they are mostly statistically insignificant.
F31|Impacts of Exchange Rate on Vietnam-Japan Trade Balance: A Nonlinear Asymmetric Cointegration Approach|The paper examines the impacts of exchange rate on Vietnam’s trade balance with Japan based on the employment of industry-level data in a set of linear and nonlinear auto-regressive distributed lag models. Results from the models indicate a degree of bias in regression when using aggregate data and a linear ARDL approach. Among 19 industries under consideration, the NARDL model presents different responses from 16 industries, which account for 40% of imports and 60% of exports between Vietnam and Japan, to exchange rate movements. The trade balance of each industry responds differently towards exchange rate and asymmetric reactions are found in 9 out of 16 industries affected by changes in exchange rate. The model using aggregate data shows that exchange rate positively affects Vietnam-Japan trade balance in case of currency depreciation, whereas currency appreciation has no impact on the trade balance between the two countries. Besides, results of the model using aggregate data reveal that the level of economic activity of Japan exerts positive impacts on Vietnam’s trade balance with Japan.
F31|Модель Реального Обменного Курса Рубля С Марковскими Переключениями Режимов<BR>[Modeling real exchange rate of the Russian ruble using Markov regime-switching approach]|In this paper we analyze the relationship between the real Russian ruble exchange rate and real oil prices using the error correction model with Markov regime switching, which allows for changes in exchange rate policy. We find that during the period 1999-2018 real exchange rate dynamics was characterized by two clearly distinguishable regimes, one with fast and the other with slow adjustment to long-term equilibrium in response to oil price shocks. Further model testing shows that long-term relationship between real exchange rate and oil price is invariant to regime change. We also find that, despite adoption of a floating exchange rate policy in 2014, inflexible real exchange rate regime has been periodically identified in recent years. This could be due to the new budget rule, according to which Russian Ministry of Finance in February 2017 started purchasing foreign currencies in amount of excess oil and gas earnings of the federal budget.
F31|Central Bank Intervention in Foreign Exchange Market under Managed Float: A Three Regime Threshold VAR Analysis of Indian Rupee-US Dollar Exchange Rate|We try to comprehensively analyze the nuances of Central Bank’s intervention in the foreign exchange market under a managed float exchange rate regime. We employ a three regime threshold VAR model and identify two endogenously determined threshold values of exchange rate cycle beyond which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes in the Indian Rupee–US Dollar (Re/$) exchange rate market. We find that, as FIIs flow in, RBI’s interventions, mainly through open market operations, are successful in bringing the Re/$ exchange rate within the desired band. Within the band, the RBI tries only to mitigate domestic inflationary conditions.
F31|Study of currency risk and the hedging strategies|The globalization of financial markets achieved by dynamic technological advancements, financial market liberalisation and the departure of capital controls have urged all MNC with foreign money streams the need to manage foreign exchange exposure risks introduced by a volatile exchange system. Today, multinational firms are striving to create methods and methodologies for an efficient and effective exchange risk management. The foreign exchange strategy embraced is essential to an MNC in the present-day condition because of the great inconstancy in transaction rates and needs to advance with the dynamic structure of the organisation. Further, given the way that organisations are continually signing commercial and business contracts titled in foreign currencies, precise estimation and supervision of exposure and economic risks have turned out to be vital to the success of an MNC. This paper review the traditional types of exchange rate risks faced by the firms due to the surge of global quest for trade across borders. The paper further explain the importance of risk management strategies with special reference to hedging and outline the various hedging strategies both external and internal used by Multinational companies (MNC’s).
F31|A Consumption-Based Approach to Exchange Rate Predictability|This paper provides evidence of short-run predictability for the real exchange rate by performing out-of-sample tests of a forecasting equation which is derived from a consumption-based asset pricing model. In this model, the real exchange rate is predictable as a result of the implications of preferences with habit persistence on the pricing of international assets. The implied predictors are: domestic, US and world consumption growth. Empirical exercises show evidence of short-term predictability on the bilateral rates of 15 out of 17 countries vis-à-vis the US over the post Bretton-Woods float. A GMM estimation of the parameters of the model also finds evidence of the presence of habits in consumers’ preferences.
F31|On a Globalized Exchange Rate Model and Currency Unions: A Note|The paper considered a global exchange rate system as well as a currency union incorporating the new emerging economies especially those in the BRIC (Brazil-Russia-India-China) group. This mechanism is viewed however to be a buildup on the existing exchange rate system in place before and after the structural transformation of the global financial architecture and landscape. Descriptive and analytical techniques were employed in the examination of the issues involved.
F31|Superkurtosis|Very little is known on how traditional risk metrics behave in ultra high frequency trading (UHFT). We fi�ll this void �firstly by examining the existence of the intraday returns moments, and secondly by assessing the impact of their (non)existence in a risk management framework. We show that in the case of UHFT, the returns' third and fourth moments do not exist, which entails that traditional risk metrics are unable to judge capital adequacy adequately. Hence, the use of risk management techniques, such as VaR, by market participants who engage with UHFT impose serious threats to the stability of fi�nancial markets, given that capital ratios may be severely underestimated.
F31|Intuitive and Reliable Estimates of Output Gap and Real Exchange Rate Cycles for Turkey|Decomposing time series data into trend and cyclical components is among the top priorities for policy maker institutions. Comparing with the unrestricted Beveridge-Nelson decomposition and Hodrick-Prescott filter, we implement a restricted Beveridge-Nelson filter developed by Kamber et. al. (2018) which limits the volatility of trend component. Utilizing the quarterly real GDP series and monthly real exchange rate data for Turkey, we find that Beveridge-Nelson filter provides more persistent and larger cyclical values than Beveridge-Nelson decomposition. Taking the output gap estimates of Central Bank of Turkey as a benchmark, our results indicate that Beveridge-Nelson filter method yields more sensible results. We also develop a measure to make an assessment on the end-point bias. Our results show that restricted Beveridge-Nelson filter performs better than Hodrick-Prescott filter regarding the magnitude of end point bias.
F31|Is there any theory that explains the SEK?|This paper investigates if the value of the Swedish krona (SEK) against the US dollar ($) and the Euro (€) can be explained by some standard theories and fundamentals, such as the purchasing power parity, the interest rate parity, the debt-ratio and the trade balance ratio, using monthly data since Feb. 1993. All of them fail to explain why the SEK is so “weak”. The lower inflation rate in Sweden over the recent years has not strengthened the currency. Similarly, the theoretically stronger SEK implied by the lower interest rates in Sweden as the uncovered interest rate parity predicts, has not emerged yet. Finally, neither the persistent trade balance surpluses, nor the declining and very low debt ratio in Sweden have had any positive effects on the currency. It seems that the traders and investors ignore the fundamentals, speculate against the currency and keep it undervalued. Moreover, a number of simulated paths, predicted from various ARIMA-processes, based on the historic exchange rates, show that the worse exchange rates have already gone and by the end of 2020 the $ and the € will cost around 8 and 9.8 SEK respectively.
F31|Effect of Exchange Rate Volatility on Imports: Evidences from Chinese Firms|The effect of exchange rate movement on trade has been studied widely for a long history. Most literatures focus on its impacts on firms' export performances, and the performances usually refer to the intensive and extensive margins of export. Adding to the existing studies, we explore how firms adjust their imports in response to varying levels of exchange rate volatility using Chinese customs data. Our contributions include three points: (i) we are the first one to test this issue using the Chinese firm level data; (ii) besides the intensive and extensive margins, we also detect how firms adjust the number of import varieties; and (iii) our study detects the role of financial constraints on the effect of the exchange rate risk. Our empirical estimations find that firms reduce their import value, varieties, and import probability from the origin country with relatively high level of exchange rate volatility. The last finding is different from the existing literature.
F31|A new approach to estimation of actively managed component of foreign exchange reserves|Changes in foreign exchange (FX) reserves are difficult to measure in an economically meaningful way because central banks do not decompose reported data into passive and active components. Only the latter should be used when the usefulness of FX reserves in crisis management is assessed or symptoms of currency manipulations are looked for. The applicability of the existing approach to identification of active component of FX reserves is highly limited as it relies on data that are available for a relatively short timespan. To overcome these problems the new approach to estimation of active component of FX reserves is laid out. It makes use of a time-varying coefficient model estimated with Bayesian techniques. The empirical results are obtained for 20 countries over 1995-2017 period. The main finding is that the estimates from the new approach are highly correlated with those from the existing approach, but the timespan of the former is substantially larger than that of the latter. The estimates based on the new approach are cross-checked against the data on FX market interventions of the Czech National Bank. It is demonstrated that the estimates are in general superior to plain changes in FX reserves as a measure of FX interventions and are not worse than those from the existing approach.
F31|Forecasting realized volatility of bitcoin returns: Tail events and asymmetric loss|We use intra-day data to construct measures of the realized volatility of bitcoin returns. We then use the heterogeneous autoregressive realized volatility (HAR-RV) model to study whether indices which capture the tail behaviour (heavy-tailedness and asymmetry) of the daily returns distribution help to forecast subsequent realized volatility. We find that mainly forecasters who suffer a higher loss in case of an underprediction of realized volatility than in case of an overprediction of the same absolute size benefit from using the tail indices as predictors of realized volatility at intermediate forecast horizons. This result is robust to controlling for realized skewness and realized kurtosis, and it also applies to “bad” and “good” realized volatility.
F31|Time-Varying Impact of Uncertainty Shocks on Macroeconomic Variables of the United Kingdom: Evidence from Over 150 Years of Monthly Data|In this paper, we analyse the impact of uncertainty (corporate bond spread) shock on inflation rate, unemployment rate, monetary policy rate, and the nominal exchange rate returns of the United Kingdom over the monthly period of 1855:01 to 2016:12. Given that we use data spanning over one and a half century, we use a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) model. We find that a positive uncertainty shock reflects a negative demand shock as suggested by theory, and results in declines in the inflation, interest rate and dollar-pound exchange rate returns, and an increase in unemployment rate. However, this impact varies over time, with the strongest effect observed for the period after World War II until the start of the Great Moderation, and during the recent global crisis. Our results are in general robust to an alternative econometric framework (breaks-based VAR) and a metric of uncertainty (stock market volatility).
F31|Foreign Exchange Order Flows and the Thai Exchange Rate Dynamics|Applying the microstructure approach to exchange rates, this paper aims to shed light on the price formation process in the Thai foreign exchange market using a unique supervisory dataset of daily foreign exchange transactions from all licensed dealers in Thailand. We examine the main drivers of different types of order flows and the effect of resident and non-resident customer order flows on the Thai exchange rate. The results suggest that non-resident order flows have an important influence on movements in the Thai baht, while resident order flows do not. Regarding investors' trading behavior, we find that non-resident order flows are driven by both fundamentals and movements of the Thai baht. Specifically, non-resident players appear to be 'trend-followers' with regard to exchange rate returns, exerting buying pressure when the baht recently appreciated. In contrast, domestic players tend to behave as 'contrarians', by buying the Thai baht after it depreciates.
F31|Exchange Rate Pass-Through: A Competitive Search Approach|We develop an open economy monetary model with heterogeneous households which is characterized by incomplete pass-through of exchange rate movements to import prices. Partial pass-through arises in our environment due to the presence of competitive search in international goods' markets. Under competitive search, agents choose a sub-market in which to exchange goods, where different sub-markets are characterized by different price and trading probability combinations. Preference and policy shocks which induce exchange rate movements cause households to choose a different sub-market for their purchases of traded goods--an extensive margin response. These responses mitigate the direct effect of nominal exchange rate changes on equilibrium traded goods' prices, thereby generating incomplete exchange rate pass-through to goods' prices. In the calibrated model, exchange rate pass-through due to foreign shocks ranges between 19% and 62%, which is in the range of import price pass-through estimates for developed economies. Due to risk aversion by households, the magnitude of pass-through depends on the size and direction of the initial shock, making the model consistent with the observed phenomenon of asymmetric pass-through. Importantly, by incorporating household heterogeneity, we are able to examine the role of precautionary savings in affecting pass-through, characterize how pass-through varies across different types of households, and examine the distributional effects of exchange rate movements.
F31|Hierarchical Time Varying Estimation of a Multi Factor Asset Pricing Model| This paper presents a new hierarchical methodology for estimating multi factor dynamic asset pricing models. The approach is loosely based on the sequential approach of Fama and MacBeth (1973). However, the hierarchical method uses very flexible bandwidth selection methods in kernel weighted regressions which can emphasize local, or recent data and information to derive the most appropriate estimates of risk premia and factor loadings at each point of time. The choice of bandwidths and weighting schemes, are achieved by cross validation. This leads to consistent estimators of the risk premia and factor loadings. Also, out of sample forecasting for stocks and two large portfolios indicates that the hierarchical method leads to statistically significant improvement in forecast RMSE.
F31|Oil Prices, Exchange Rates and Interest Rates|There has been much interest in the relationship between the price of crude oil, the value of the U.S. dollar, and the U.S. interest rate since the 1980s. For example, the sustained surge in the real price of oil in the 2000s is often attributed to the declining real value of the U.S. dollar as well as low U.S. real interest rates, along with a surge in global real economic activity. Quantifying these effects one at a time is difficult not only because of the close relationship between the interest rate and the exchange rate, but also because demand and supply shocks in the oil market in turn may affect the real value of the dollar and real interest rates. We propose a novel identification strategy for disentangling the causal effects of oil demand and oil supply shocks from the effects of exogenous shocks to the U.S. real interest rate and exogenous shocks to the real value of the U.S. dollar. We empirically evaluate popular views about the role of exogenous real exchange rate shocks in driving the real price of oil, and we examine the extent to which shocks in the global oil market drive the U.S. real exchange rate and U.S. real interest rates. Our evidence for the first time provides direct empirical support for theoretical models of the link between oil prices, exchange rates, and interest rates.
F31|Global trends in interest rates|The trend in the world real interest rate for safe and liquid assets fluctuated close to 2% for more than a century, but has dropped significantly over the past three decades. This decline has been common among advanced economies, as trends in real interest rates across countries have converged over this period. It was driven by an increase in the convenience yield for safety and liquidity and by lower global economic growth.

F31|Measuring volatility spill-over effects of crude oil prices on Ghana’s exchange rate and stock market between 1991 and 2015|This paper examines the shock spill-over and volatility spill-over effects from crude oil prices to the Ghana exchange rate and the Ghana stock market index. We employ the multivariate GARCH BEKK and TBEKK models using monthly data from January 1991 to December 2015. We address two central issues. First, whether crude oil price movements affect the Ghana exchange rate and the Ghana stock market. Second, whether the crude oil price effect depends on the treatment of crude oil prices as exogenous or endogenous. Our findings indicate that world crude oil prices have significant spill-over effects on the exchange rate, and this result is unaffected by the treatment of world crude oil prices as exogenous or endogenous. However, the relationship between crude oil prices and the Ghana stock market depends on whether the crude oil price is exogenous or endogenous. The implication of these results is that internationally diversified portfolio investors in Ghana should use hedging strategies such as currency forwards, futures, and options to protect their investments from exchange rate risk emanating from oil price shocks. The government should also encourage the use of renewable energy such as solar to help reduce the country’s dependence on oil.
F31|Does the exogeneity of oil prices matter in the oil price-macro-economy relationship for Ghana?|Using annual data from 1971 to 2014 we consider whether the relationship between crude oil prices and the macro-economy in the relatively small economy of Ghana is affected by the treatment of crude oil prices as exogenous or endogenous. We use vector autoregressions, vector error-correction models, scenario-based dynamic forecasting, and autoregressive distributive lag specifications. There is little evidence that international crude oil prices have a significant negative effect on Ghana’s output in either the short-run and long-run, regardless of whether crude oil prices are treated as exogenous or endogenous. This implies that increases in crude oil prices do not put a binding constraint on the monetary authorities to loosen monetary policy to offset its adverse effect on output. If inflation is a priority, policy makers could focus on inflation stabilization by tightening monetary policy when oil prices rise.
F31|The Yen Exchange Rate and the Hollowing Out of the Japanese Industry|Since the demise of the Bretton Woods system, the yen has seen several episodes of strong appreciation, including in the late 1970s, after the 1985 Plaza Agreement, the early and late 1990s and after 2008. These appreciations have not only been associated with “expensive yen recessions” resulting from negative effects on exports; since the late 1980s, the strong yen has also raised concerns about a deindustrialisation of the Japanese economy. Against this backdrop, the paper investigates the effects of changes to the yen exchange rate on the hollowing out of the Japanese industrial sector. To this end, the paper uses both aggregate and industry‐specific data to gauge the effects of yen fluctuations on the output and exports of different Japanese industries, exploiting new data for industry‐specific real effective exchange rates. Our findings support the view that the periods of yen appreciation had more than just transitory effects on Japanese manufacturing. The results also provide indication of hysteresis effects on manufacturing. While there are certainly also other factors that have contributed to a hollowing out of Japanese industry, a strong yen played a role, too.
F31|Real Effective Exchange Rates determinants and growth: lessons from Italian regions|In this paper we analyse the price competitiveness of the Italian regions by computing the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) for each region, deflated by CPI and vis-à-vis the main partner countries. We use them to look for the medium-term determinants, finding significant heterogeneities in the role of government consumption and investment expenditure. Government consumption has an extremely negative effect on competitiveness in North-Eastern Italy, Southern Italy and Lazio. Investment plays a negative role especially in the North-West, while it can be positive for competitiveness in Lazio and Southern Italy. We also find that the transfer theory does not necessarily hold and it even behaves in the opposite direction in case of North-Eastern Italy and Lazio. Lastly, we show that an increase in the regional price competitiveness influences regional growth positively only in the long run and spillovers may play a role.
F31|Exchange Rate Pass-Through to Consumer Prices: The Increasing Role of Energy Prices|A group of researchers has asserted that the rate of exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to domestic prices has declined substantially over the last few decades. We revisit this claim of a downward trend in ERPT to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in a vector autoregressive (VAR) model for US macroeconomic data under the current floating exchange rate regime. Our VAR approach nests the conventional single equation method, revealing very weak evidence of ERPT during the pre-1990 era, but statistically significant evidence of ERPT during the post-1990 era, sharply contrasting with previous findings. After statistically confirming a structural break in ERPT to total CPI via Hansen's (2001) test procedure, we seek the source of the structural break with disaggregated level CPIs, pinning down a key role of energy prices in the break. The dependency of US energy consumption on imports increased since the 1990s until the recent recession. This change magnifies effects of the exchange rate shocks on domestic energy prices, resulting in greater responses of the total CPI via this energy price channel.
F31|Do Fixers Perform Worse than Non-Fixers during Global Recessions and Recoveries?|There is an important debate about how economies with different exchange rate regimes performed during the Great Recession and its ensuing recovery. While economic theory suggests that economies with fixed exchange rates are more affected and recover more slowly from global shocks than economies with non-fixed exchange rates, the empirical evidence on the most recent global recession has been mixed. This paper examines the exchange rate and economic growth nexus and assesses how this relationship is affected by the four global recessions and recoveries the world economy has experienced post-Bretton Woods. While there is no robust long-term relationship between exchange rate regimes and growth, there is evidence that fixers recover from global recessions at a weaker pace than non-fixers.
F31|Consumption dynamics and the expectation channel in a Small Open Economy|The transmission mechanism between consumption and its fundamentals has been under reviews in the literature from Friedman’s permanent income hypothesis to household’s liquidity constraints. One particular angle to explain consumption is focused on the role of consumer expectations as a determinant of consumption spending. Here we explore alternative measures for consumer expectations (captured by surveys to households) by taking into account general manager expectations and by using imports of durable consumption goods (which capture consumer confidence about future economic conditions). We argue that, for a small open economy, the expectations channel is well captured by alternative measures; find that even though there is a pass-through from expectations to consumption, this effect tends to have a short-period effect; and also report those values and periods of time for which the alternative measures have a significant impact on consumption.
F31|Do remittances worsen export diversification?|"The paper explores the impact of workers' remittances on the level of export diversification. The hypothesis is that significant inflow of remittances causes overvaluation of real exchange rate, which in turn deteriorates diversity of export. The theoretical base is in line with the Dutch disease phenomenon. The paper uses annual cross-national panel data over 2000-2016 period and System GMM methodology. The evidence suggests that indeed large inflow of remittances is associated with less diversified export. The economic intuition behind is that remittance-caused real exchange rate appreciation unevenly suppresses export of goods: some goods ""suffer"" more than others do. In terms of the number of product-names, a percentage point increase in remittances to GDP sent home ""reduces"" variety of export by approximately five active lines. There are other interesting findings as well. An improvement of government effectiveness facilitates overall export diversification; terms of trade improvement and rise of real exchange rate volatility mostly increase export concentration rather than alter number of exported product-names."
F31|The Danger of a “Geyser Disease” Effect: Structural Fragility of the Tourism-Led Recovery in Iceland|The fall of the Icelandic economy in 2008 highlighted the destructive effects of unbridled markets. Yet, the small Nordic country has experienced an impressive recovery, so much so that in recent years its annual growth rates have been significantly higher than those of the overwhelming majority of advanced capitalist countries. Several commentators have attributed this extraordinary accomplishment to the interventionist state policies adopted by successive Icelandic governments. The aim of this article is to debunk this myth by delving into the fragile foundations that the current Icelandic economic boom rests on. We argue that the substantial growth of the real exchange rate has made the rapid absorption of unemployment compatible with price stability during the recovery period. At the same time, the boom in tourism services made the impressive appreciation of the Icelandic króna compatible with the country’s external balance. However, the laissez-faire approach shown by the Icelandic authorities towards the krona appreciation hasseverely penalized most of the tradable sector, in which the bulk of skilled labor is usually concentrated. Arguably, the heavy specialization in the tourism sector, by restricting sources of productivity growth and international competitiveness, will render the current level of unemployment and real wages inconsistent with internal and external equilibrium in Iceland in the long run.
F31|The Effect of Brexit on the UK Economy (so far)|The political turmoil in the UK following the referendum on future membership of the European Union in 2016 provides a natural experiment for studying the effects of political uncertainty (in the Knightian sense) on the economy. We find that the subsequent confusion and infighting in British politics has not affected the real economy much – employment is at a historical high and output growth is positive – but there are some signs of slowing investment and house price increases. The stock market has also not been much affected although it did fall after the referendum of 2016. The main effect of the Brexit vote and the subsequent political developments is found in the currency market where news that make a hard Brexit more likely cause the currency to depreciate. We conclude that leaving the European Union without an agreement is likely to make the currency depreciate and the stock market fall while output declines. In contrast, leaving with an agreement that gives continued access to the Single Market would likely make the currency appreciate, the stock market rise and employment and output increase further
F31|Estimating the Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Total Exports|This paper shows that real effective exchange rate (REER) regressions, the standard approach for estimating the response of aggregate exports to exchange rate changes, imply biased estimates of the underlying elasticities. We provide a new aggregate regression specification that is consistent with bilateral trade flows micro-founded by the gravity equation. This theory-consistent aggregation leads to unbiased estimates when prices are set in an international currency as postulated by the dominant currency paradigm. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to compare elasticity estimates based on this new “ideal-REER” regression against typical regression specifications found in the REER literature. The results show that the biases are small (around 1 percent) for the exchange rate and large (around 10 percent) for the demand elasticity. We find empirical support for this prediction from annual trade flow data. The difference between elasticities estimated on the bilateral and aggregate levels reduces significantly when applying an ideal-REER regression rather than a standard REER approach.
F31|International Reserves Management in a Model of Partial Sovereign Default|Despite the cost imposed by the interest rate spread between sovereign debt and international reserves, emerging countriesâ€™ governments maintain stocks of both. I investigate the optimality of this joint accumulation of assets and liabilities using a quantitative model of sovereign debt, in which: i) international reserves only function to smooth consumption, before or after a default; ii) the sovereignâ€™s decision to repudiate debt determine the spread; iii) lenders are risk-averse; and iv) default is partial. Simulated statistics from the benchmark model match their observed counterparts for average debt and spread, consumption volatility, and the main correlations among the relevant variables. Due to the presence of partial default and risk-averse lenders, the model also produces a mean reserve level of 7.7% of GDP, indicating that the optimal policy is to hold positive amounts of reserves.
F31|Measuring the cost of U.S. housing policy|Unlike other developed countries, the U.S. has a high proportion of long-term fixed-rate mortgages (30 years). This is partly because the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSE), which operate in the secondary mortgage market, reduce the interest rate of these contracts. This document measures the cost and studies the consequences of such policy. GSE's actions are modeled as an interest rate subsidy applied directly to 30-year mortgages, in the context of a general equilibrium model with two types of agents, housing and default. The cost of this policy is measured as the minimum subsidy that makes households choose 30-year fixed-rate contracts over one-year contracts, in equilibrium. The resulting subsidy is 36 basis points. Finally, I investigate how the results vary with the duration of the fixed-rate mortgage contract, and I find that mortgage terms under 30 years require smaller subsidies.
F31|Evolution and Characteristics of the Exchange Rate Pass Through to Prices in Mexico|This paper analyzes the exchange rate pass through to consumer prices in Mexico using different methodologies. First, we estimate Vector Autoregressive Models (VAR). Subsequently, we estimate Autoregressive Distributed Lags Models (ARDL) in order to make a long run analysis. In particular, we find that the exchange rate pass through to consumer prices is low and has barely changed in relation with the findings in previous studies. We also estimate that when the economy grows above its long-run trend, the point estimation of the exchange rate pass through is larger on average. Finally, we provide some evidence of asymmetry in the exchange rate pass through, that is, the point estimation of the exchange rate pass through is greater when there is a depreciation than when there is a currency appreciation. It should be noted that in the long run analysis these results are preserved.
F31|Cheap employment: ¿Aumenta el empleo manufacturero con una depreciación real?|La literatura económica establece que la depreciación de la tasa de cambio favorece la competitividad de un país al disminuir no sólo los precios relativos de la producción nacional con respecto al resto del mundo sino también al reducir el precio de insumos productivos como el trabajo. De acuerdo con lo anterior, un aumento generalizado de la tasa de cambio o una depreciación debería, ceteris paribus, aumentar los niveles de ocupación del país. Para el caso colombiano, poco se sabe del efecto causal de la depreciación real en la generación de empleo. En este documento se explora el efecto que las variaciones de la tasa de cambio real tienen en la variación de la ocupación industrial para las trece principales ciudades. Para lograr lo anterior, hacemos uso de la composición industrial de cada ciudad y de sus niveles de interacción con el resto del mundo con el fin de identificar el grado de exposición a fluctuaciones de la tasa de cambio. Los resultados sugieren que para el caso de la industria manufacturera, transable, una depreciación de la tasa de cambio exportadora del 1% por encima del promedio de la muestra, genera un aumento en el empleo del 0.2%. Dicho efecto no se ve amplificado por una mayor orientación exportadora. De otro lado, una depreciación real de la tasa importadora del 1% por encima del promedio de la muestra, está relacionado con una reducción en el empleo local cercano al 0.4%. Este último resultado sugeriría la existencia de complementariedades entre el empleo local y los insumos extranjeros pues frente al encarecimiento de la producción importada, se reduce no sólo la demanda de importados sino también la del empleo local. En general, la evidencia sugiere que la depreciación real tiene mayores efectos sobre el empleo manufacturero por el encarecimiento de las importaciones que por el efecto de abaratamiento de las exportaciones. **** ABSTRACT: The economic literature establishes that increases in the exchange rate (i.e., a depreciation) favors a country's competitiveness by decreasing not only country’s relative prices but the price of productive inputs such as labor. Little is known about the causal effect between exchange rate depreciations and the level of employment in Colombia. This paper explores the effects that changes in the real exchange rate have on industrial employment for the thirteen major cities of the country. To do so, we take into account the degree of exposure of each city to exchange rate fluctuations. We use the industrial composition of each city and its levels of interaction with the rest of the world. The results suggest that when the export exchange rate depreciates 1% above the average of the sample, industrial employment increases by 0.2%. This effect is not amplified by a greater export orientation. Contrarily, when the import exchange rate depreciates 1% above the average of the sample, local employment is reduced by 0.4%. This last result suggests the existence of complementarities between local employment and foreign inputs, as not only the demand for imported goods but also for local employment is reduced when the exchange rate increases. The evidence suggests that the largest effects of an exchange rate depreciation on industrial employment are mainly due to the increase of the imports' cost and less due to cheapening exports.
F31|FX intervention and domestic credit: Evidence from high-frequency micro data|We employ a rarely available high-frequency micro data set to study the impact of foreign exchange intervention on domestic credit growth. We find that sterilised purchases of dollars by the central bank dampens the flow of new domestic corporate loans in Colombia. Slowing the pace of currency appreciation plays a key role in dampening credit expansion. Our analysis sheds light on the role of FX intervention as part of the financial stability-oriented policy response to credit booms associated with capital inflow surges.
F31|Effectiveness of FX Intervention and the Flimsiness of Exchange rate Expectations|Most of the foreign exchange intervention literature overlooks the influence of market uncertainty when evaluating effectiveness. In this paper we take a fresh new look at how this uncertainty amplifies exchange rate effects. Our contribution is twofold. We first posit a partial equilibrium model with frictions to illustrate that when uncertainty is low, intervention is less effective, for agents are willing to bet against the central bank. Conversely, when uncertainty is high, intervention faces a weaker countervailing force from speculators and arbitragers. Second, we empirically test for the incremental effects of flimsy exchange rate fundamentals by using a sharp policy discontinuity in the way the Central Bank of Colombia intervened in the FX market. Our results indicate that market uncertainty increases depreciation of domestic currency in approximately 1% following central bank purchases of foreign currency and extends its duration in up to 2 weeks. Additionally, these purchases have an incremental effect in stemming exchange rate volatility in up to 7%. **** RESUMEN: En este trabajo examinamos la influencia de la incertidumbre sobre la tasa de cambio futura en la efectividad de la intervención cambiaria. Nuestra contribución consta de dos partes. Primero, desarrollamos un modelo teórico de equilibrio parcial para ilustrar cómo la efectividad cambiaria aumenta a medida que aumenta la incertidumbre sobre la tasa de cambio futura o de sus determinantes. Segundo, presentamos evidencia empírica de esta relación haciendo uso del esquema de intervención cambiaria del Banco de la República, empleado durante el periodo 2002-2012, a través de opciones put de volatilidad. Nuestros resultados indican que, en presencia de alta incertidumbre en los fundamentales de la tasa de cambio, la efectividad de la intervención esterilizada aumenta en aproximadamente 1% y su duración se extiende hasta por dos semanas. Adicionalmente, encontramos que, en períodos de alta incertidumbre, la intervención reduce la volatilidad cambiaria hasta en un 7% adicional.
F31|El rol del sector real en el mercado de derivados y su impacto sobre la tasa de cambio|Aunque las negociaciones de los intermediarios del mercado cambiario (IMC) con el sector real en el mercado de forwards peso-dólar son bajas en comparación con las operaciones transadas con agentes offshore, es importante entender el comportamiento de dicho sector y su impacto en el mercado cambiario. En este trabajo se evalúa si el sector real ha tenido un impacto en la tasa de cambio, analizando la evolución diaria de su posición neta en el mercado de forwards peso-dólar. De acuerdo con la evolución de los montos negociados en el mercado de forwards por parte de los IMC con diferentes contrapartes, se observa que el sector real en algunas ocasiones ha tomado posiciones que parecen ir en sentido contrario a las operaciones negociadas por los agentes offshore, las cuales podrían tener un efecto estabilizador en la tasa de cambio. Mediante modelos EGARCH y VARX-MGARCH se encuentra evidencia de que las posiciones que toma el sector real tienen un impacto sobre la tasa de cambio. Sin embargo, ese efecto no ha sido estable entre 2008 y 2015, y se ha reducido en el tiempo. Igualmente, las posiciones del sector real en el mercado forward no tienen un efecto estabilizador sobre el tipo de cambio pues ante compras netas del offshore en dicho mercado no se encuentra evidencia que el sector real tome una posición vendedora neta. **** ABSTRACT: Although transactions of foreign exchange market intermediaries with the real sector in the peso-dollar market are low in comparison to the ones with offshore agents, it is important to understand the behavior of the real sector and its impact on the exchange market. This paper assesses whether the real sector has an impact on the spot exchange rate by analyzing the daily evolution of its net position in the peso-dollar forward market. According to the amounts negotiated in this market segment, it is observed that the real sector has sometimes taken positions that go in the opposite direction to the operations negotiated by offshore agents. This behavior could have a stabilizing effect on the exchange rate. Through EGARCH and VARX-MGARCH models, there is evidence that the positions taken by the real sector have an impact on the spot exchange rate. However, this effect has not been stable between 2008 and 2015, and has been reduced over time. Likewise, the positions of the real sector in the forward market do not have a stabilizing effect on the exchange rate, since against net purchases of the offshore market there is no evidence that the real sector takes a net selling position.
F31|International Reserve Policy and Effectiveness of Sterilized FX Intervention in Colombia|Two FX policy issues are discussed based on the recent Colombian experience. First, the increased participation of foreign investors in local bond markets since 2014 induced a reassessment of international reserve adequacy. We present the resulting LCR-type methodology to evaluate adequacy, together with a brief description of the international reserve management strategy in Colombia. Second, we shed some light on the debate regarding the effectiveness of sterilized FX intervention, showing that exchange rate effects depend on the “flimsiness” of exchange rate expectations or their fundamental determinants. To support this, we provide both empirical and theoretical evidence. **** RESUMEN: En este trabajo analizamos algunos aspectos sobre las políticas de reservas internacionales y la intervención cambiaria en Colombia en los últimos años. En particular, discutimos el nivel adecuado de las reservas internacionales, la gestión de los portafolios de reservas y la efectividad de la intervención cambiaria. Argumentamos que el fuerte aumento de la participación de inversionistas extranjeros en los mercados de capitales locales registrado desde 2014 ha implicado una reflexión sobre el nivel adecuado de liquidez externa del país. Respecto a la efectividad de la intervención cambiaria esterilizada, encontramos que la incertidumbre cambiaria, capturada a través de la volatilidad de la tasa de cambio a 1 mes, magnifica el efecto de la intervención en aproximadamente 1% y sus efectos perduran durante 3 semanas.
F31|The Exchange Rate and Oil Prices in Colombia: A High Frequency Analysis|We study the relationship between daily oil prices and nominal exchange rates between 1995 and 2019 in Colombia through a Time-Varying Vector Auto-Regressions with residual Stochastic Volatility, TV-VAR-SV, model. For this task we also employ cointegration, Univariate Auto-Regressions with residual Stochastic Volatility, UAR-SVTV, and De-trended Cross Correlation, DCC analyses. We found that a stable longrun relationship between the two processes is lacking. We also found significant time variation in residual volatility and co-volatility. More specifically, we found that both periods of time, the international financial crisis and the oil price drop of 2015, behave conspicuously different from other “more normal” times. These results are consistent with a shift in the features of the DCC at the start of the crisis. Before the crises the DCCs are positive but weak for different windows sizes, turning negative and significant after it. The latter DCCs and their significance increase with the window size. These results are concurrent, also, with two clearly differentiated periods of time; one when oil production was not financially feasible, and thus production, exports and oil related currency inflows were small, and the other when oil production became feasible because of the price increase, which led to a boom in exploration, production, exports and oil related currency inflows. **** RESUMEN: Estudiamos la evolución de la relación entre los precios diarios del petróleo y la tasa de cambio nominal Colombiana entre 1995 y 2019 a través de un modelo de Vectores Auto-Regresivos Tiempo-Variantes con Volatilidad Estocástica Residual. Para esto empleamos también técnicas de co-integración, Auto-Regresiones Univariadas con Volatilidad Estocástica Residual, y Correlaciones Cruzadas Des-tendeciadas. Se encontró que no existe una relación estable de largo plazo entre estos dos procesos. También hallamos evidencia de variación temporal de la volatilidad y co-volatilidad residual. Más específicamente, encontramos que tanto la crisis financiera global como la reducción de los precios de petróleo de 2015 son periodos particularmente distintos de otros periodos “más normales”. Estos resultados son consistentes con un cambio en el comportamiento de las DCC al inicio de la crisis financiera de 2008. En efecto, antes de la crisis estas correlaciones eran positivas pero poco significativas para diferentes tama˜nos de la ventana de estimación, pero después de la crisis se tornaron negativas y significancias. Las últimas DCCs y su significancia se incrementaron a mayores tama˜nos de la ventana. Estos resultados coinciden con dos periodos de tiempo claramente diferenciados en Colombia, uno en el cual la producción petrolera no era financieramente factible, y en consecuencia la producción, exportación y flujos entrantes de divisas por petróleo eran pequeños, y otro donde la producción fue factible, conduciendo a un boom en la exploración, producción, exportación y en los flujos entrantes de divisas relacionados con petróleo.
F31|Estimating the Exchange Rate Pass-Through: A Time-Varying Vector Auto-Regression with Residual Stochastic Volatility Approach|The adoption of a Time-Varying Vector Auto-Regression with residual Stochastic Volatility approach to address the state and time dependency of the exchange rate pass-through, ERPT, is proposed. This procedure is employed to estimate the size, duration and stability of the ERPT to flexible relative price changes in Colombia through a fairly simple Phillips curve. For this, the generalized impulse responses, i.e. pass-throughs, from different periods of time are compared. It was found that the ERPT is bigger and faster than previous estimates for broader price indexes. It was also also found that regardless of the existence of time-varying shock sizes, i.e. time varying standard deviations, the ERPT before full Inflation Targeting, IT, is marked and significantly larger before than during full IT, and also that the ERPT relates to real exchange rate volatility. The second results relates to the benefits derived from the adoption of full IT in this country. It was finally found that the output gap and flexible relative price change residual volatilities drop permanently and importantly at 1998Q3, emphasizing the role of the free float regime adoption in the success of IT in this country. **** RESUMEN: La adopción de un enfoque de Vectores Auto-Regresivos Tiempo-Variantes con Volatilidad Estocástica residual para examinar la variación temporal y sobre el estado de la economía del Traspaso de la Tasa de Cambio, TCC, es propuesta. Este enfoque es empleado para estimar el tamaño, duración y estabilidad del TTC a los cambios de los precios relativos de los flexibles en Colombia a través de una curva de Phillips relativamente simple. Para esto, las funciones de impulso respuesta generalizadas, es decir los TTC, de diferentes periodos de tiempo son comparados. Se encontró que el TTC es más grande y rápido que estimaciones anteriores para agregados más amplios de precios. Se encontró también que a pesar del tamaño tiempo-variante de los choques, es decir las desviaciones estándar, el traspaso antes del Esquema completo de Inflación Objetivo, EIO, es marcada y significativamente más grande que el traspaso durante este, y también se halló evidencia de una relación entre el traspaso y la volatilidad de la tasa de cambio real. El segundo resultado se relaciona con los beneficios derivados de la adopción del esquema de inflación objetivo en este país. Se encontró, finalmente, que la volatilidad residual de la brecha del PIB y del cambio de los precios relativos de los flexibles cayó substancial y permanentemente en 1998Q3, enfatizando el papel del régimen de libre flotación en el éxito del EIO en este país.
F31|Beyond the Doomsday Economics of “Proof-of-Work” in Cryptocurrencies|This paper discusses the economics of how Bitcoin achieves data immutability, and thus payment finality, via costly computations, i.e., “proof-of-work.” Further, it explores what the future might hold for cryptocurrencies modelled on this type of consensus algorithm. The conclusions are, first, that Bitcoin counterfeiting via “double-spending” attacks is inherently profitable, making payment finality based on proof-of-work extremely expensive. Second, the transaction market cannot generate an adequate level of “mining” income via fees as users free-ride on the fees of other transactions in a block and in the subsequent blockchain. Instead, newly minted bitcoins, known as block rewards, have made up the bulk of mining income to date. Looking ahead, these two limitations imply that liquidity is set to fall dramatically as these block rewards are phased out. Simple calculations suggest that once block rewards are zero, it could take months before a Bitcoin payment is final, unless new technologies are deployed to speed up payment finality. Second-layer solutions such as the Lightning Network might help, but the only fundamental remedy would be to depart from proof-of-work, which would probably require some form of social coordination or institutionalisation.
F31|Safe assets: made, not just born|"Official reserve managers have a big stake in the debate over safe assets: their portfolios just about define such assets. This paper conveys the message that reserve managers need not worry about a shortage of safe assets. The debate turns first on whether demand for dollar safe assets will grow as rapidly as emerging market economies (EMEs). Second, it turns on whether the supply of dollar safe assets only grows with US fiscal deficits. Neither holds. On the demand side, EMEs' growth does not require ever higher dollar reserves. Indeed, the global economy may have reached ""peak reserves"" in 2014. On the supply side, law and policy extend state backing to various IOUs, thereby creating safe assets. US government support for the housing agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has made their debt into safe assets, albeit with wobbles. Federal Reserve liquidity, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance, and, in extremis as in 2008, Treasury equity also work to make US bank deposits safe. Elsewhere, government support of banks allows those from well rated countries to compete with US banks in issuing safe dollar deposits. Moreover, supranational organisations, non-US sovereigns and their agencies all compete with the US Treasury in issuing safe dollar bonds. In allocating their dollar foreign exchange reserves, central banks make room for such competitors. In particular, they hold more than a third of such reserves in instruments other than US Treasury securities."
F31|FX intervention and domestic credit: evidence from high-frequency micro data|We employ a rarely available high-frequency micro dataset to study the impact of foreign exchange intervention on domestic credit growth. We find that sterilised purchases of dollars by the central bank dampens the flow of new domestic corporate loans in Colombia. Slowing the pace of currency appreciation plays a key role in dampening credit expansion. Our analysis sheds light on the role of FX intervention as part of the financial stability-oriented policy response to credit booms associated with capital inflow surges. **** RESUMEN: En este trabajo utilizamos datos panel de frecuencia diaria, para estudiar el impacto de las intervenciones cambiarias sobre el crédito comercial. Para el caso colombiano, encontramos que las compras (esterilizadas) de divisas ayudaron a frenar el crecimiento del crédito, sobre todo en momentos donde hubo fuertes entradas de capital. Nuestros hallazgos también indican que la devaluación de la moneda jugó un papel fundamental en la disminución del crédito. Nuestro análisis resalta el papel de la intervención cambiaria como herramienta de estabilidad financiera.
F31|Exchange rate puzzles: evidence from rigidly fixed nominal exchange rate systems|We examine several major exchange rate puzzles: the excess volatility of real exchange rates; their excess reaction to the real interest rate differentials; the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) puzzle; the excess persistence of real exchange rates; the exchange rate disconnect puzzle; and the consumption correlation puzzle. We examine the behaviour of real exchange rates among pairs of economies that have rigidly fixed nominal exchange rates, eg countries within the euro area, regions in China and Canada, and Hong Kong SAR vis-à-vis the United States, compared with that among non-euro-area OECD economies. Our results suggest that some of these puzzles are less puzzling under a rigidly fixed exchange rate regime. In particular, real exchange rates appear to have no or little excess volatility; excess reaction of the real exchange rate to real interest rates is less common; there is less disconnect between the real exchange rate and the economic fundamentals; and uncovered interest rate parity appears to hold more frequently in these economies. However, real exchange rates are as persistent in these economies as in the floating rate economies and there appears to be little difference in risk-sharing across countries with fixed versus floating nominal exchange rates. These results may have implications for exchange rate modelling.
F31|Geographic spread of currency trading: the renminbi and other EM currencies|This paper studies the ongoing diffusion of renminbi trading across the globe, the first such research of an international currency. It analyses the distribution in offshore renminbi trading in 2013 and 2016, using comprehensive data from the Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Market Activity. In 2013, Asian centres favoured by the policy of renminbi internationalisation had big shares in global renminbi trading. In the following three years, renminbi trading seemed to converge to the spatial pattern of all currencies, with a half-life of seven to eight years. The previously most traded emerging market currency, the Mexican peso, shows a similar pattern, although it is converging to the global norm more slowly. Three other major emerging market currencies show a qualitatively similar evolution in the geography of their offshore trading. Overall the renminbi's internationalisation is tracing an arc from the influence of administrative measures to the working of market forces.
F31|Embedded supervision: how to build regulation into blockchain finance|The spread of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in finance could help to improve the efficiency and quality of supervision. This paper makes the case for embedded supervision, ie a regulatory framework that provides for compliance in tokenised markets to be automatically monitored by reading the market's ledger, thus reducing the need for firms to actively collect, verify and deliver data. After sketching out a design for such schemes, the paper explores the conditions under which distributed ledger data might be used to monitor compliance. To this end, a decentralised market is modelled that replaces today's intermediary-based verification of legal data with blockchain-enabled data credibility based on economic consensus. The key results set out the conditions under which the market's economic consensus would be strong enough to guarantee that transactions are economically final, so that supervisors can trust the distributed ledger's data. The paper concludes with a discussion of the legislative and operational requirements that would promote low-cost supervision and a level playing field for small and large firms.
F31|Do sterilized foreign exchange interventions create money?|The growth of official foreign reserves in emerging Asian countries over recent decades has been extensive but its effects on the money market appear to be well sterilized in that decreases in interest rates or acceleration of credit growth have not been registered. We analyze the effect of foreign exchange intervention on components of the banking system’s balance sheet for 19 emerging economies that pursued an independent interest rate policy and did not maintain an exchange rate peg. The sample includes six Asian countries (India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand). We apply a vector autoregressive technique to quarterly data for the period 2001Q4 to 2016Q1. For the sample as a whole, we find that money stock tends to expand in response to an increase in the foreign reserves of the central bank. For the Asian countries in particular, we conclude that external transactions have contributed to money growth acceleration despite sterilization that succeeded in stabilizing interest rates.
F31|Currency mispricing and dealer balance sheets|We relate currency mispricing originating from the breakdown of covered interest rate parity to the dealer balance-sheet constraints resulting from the post-crisis financial regulation. Using a unique data set on contract-level foreign exchange derivatives with disclosed counterparty identities, we find that dealers with a higher leverage ratio demand an additional premium from their clients for synthetic dollar funding. We handle endogeneity using two exogenous variations associated with the public disclosure of the leverage ratio, and the introduction of the UK leverage ratio framework while controlling for changes in demand conditions at the client level.
F31|Official demand for US debt: implications for US real rates|We estimate a structural term-structure model of US real rates, where arbitrageurs accommodate demand pressures exerted by domestic and foreign official investors. Official demand affects rates by altering the aggregate price of duration risk, and thereby bond risk premiums. While foreign central banks’ demand contributed to reduce long-term real rates mainly in the years prior to the global-financial crisis, the Federal Reserve’s demand lowered rates during the QE period. Overall, the two-factor model, augmented to account for changing liquidity conditions, offers a good representation of real rates during the 2001–2016 period; however, we flag some caveats and possible extensions.
F31|Attention to the tail(s): global financial conditions and exchange rate risks|We document how the entire distribution of exchange rate returns responds to changes in global financial conditions. We measure global financial conditions as the common component of country-specific financial condition indices, computed consistently across a large panel of developed and emerging economies. Based on quantile regression results, we provide a characterisation and ranking of the tail behaviour of a large sample of currencies in response to a tightening of global financial conditions, corroborating some of the prevailing narratives about safe haven and risky currencies. We then carry out a portfolio sorting exercise to identify the macroeconomic fundamentals associated with such different tail behaviour, and find that currency portfolios sorted on the basis of relative interest rates, current account balances and levels of international reserves display a higher likelihood of large losses in response to a tightening of global financial conditions.
F31|Truths and myths about RMB misalignment : A meta-analysis|We conduct a meta-regression analysis of 69 studies that generated 937 renminbi (RMB) misalignment estimates. The Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach is adopted to allow for model selection and sampling uncertainties in assessing effects of study characteristics on these RMB misalignment estimates. Misalignment estimates are found to be influenced by the eight selected study characteristic types in our median probability model. The RMB misalignment estimate from models with various hypothetical combinations of study characteristics, however, is mostly insignificantly different from zero. It is also shown that the set of significant study characteristics is sensitive to the use of the least squares estimation method and the choice of benchmark study characteristics.
F31|Exchange Rate Shocks and Quality Adjustments|Do firms respond to cost shocks by reducing the quality of their products? Using microdata from a large Russian retailer that varies its offerings twice-yearly, we document that ruble devaluations are associated with a reduction in the observed material quality of products imported for resale, but that higher quality goods are also more profitable. We reconcile these facts using a simple multi-product sourcing model that features a demand system with expenditure switching, where more profitable products can be dropped more quickly after a cost shock. The estimated model shows that quality downgrading reduces average passthrough by 6% and has meaningful consequences for welfare.
F31|Fast trading and the virtue of entropy: evidence from the foreign exchange market|Focusing on the foreign exchange reaction to macroeconomic announcements, we show that fast trading is positively and significantly correlated with the entropy of the distribution of quoted prices in reaction to news: a larger share of fast trading increases the degree of diversity of quotes in the order book, for given liquidity, order book depth and size of order flows. Exploiting the WM Reuters’ reform of the fixing methodology in February 2015 as a natural experiment, we provide evidence that fast trading raises entropy, rather than reacting to it. While more entropy in quoted prices means noisier information and arguably complicates price discovery from an individual trader’s perspective, we show that, in the aggregate, more entropy actually brings traded prices closer to the random walk hypothesis, and improves indicators of market efficiency and quality of trade execution. We estimate that a 10 percent increase in entropy reduces the negative impact of macro news by over 60% for effective spreads, against over 40% for realized spreads and price impacts. Our findings suggest that the main mechanism by which fast trading may have desirable effects on market performance specifically hinges on enhanced heterogeneity in trading patterns, best captured by entropy.

F31|Oil prices, exchange rates, and interest rates|There has been much interest in the relationship between the price of crude oil, the value of the U.S. dollar, and the U.S. interest rate since the 1980s. For example, the sustained surge in the real price of oil in the 2000s is often attributed to the declining real value of the U.S. dollar as well as low U.S. real interest rates, along with a surge in global real economic activity. Quantifying these effects one at a time is difficult not only because of the close relationship between the interest rate and the exchange rate, but also because demand and supply shocks in the oil market in turn may affect the real value of the dollar and real interest rates. We propose a novel identification strategy for disentangling the causal effects of oil demand and oil supply shocks from the effects of exogenous shocks to the U.S. real interest rate and exogenous shocks to the real value of the U.S. dollar. We empirically evaluate popular views about the role of exogenous real exchange rate shocks in driving the real price of oil, and we examine the extent to which shocks in the global oil market drive the U.S. real exchange rate and U.S. real interest rates. Our evidence for the first time provides direct empirical support for theoretical models of the link between oil prices, exchange rates, and interest rates.
F31|Currency regimes and the carry trade|This study exploits a new long-run data set of daily bid and offered exchange rates in spot and forward markets from 1919 to the present to analyze carry returns in fixed and floating currency regimes. We first find that outsized carry returns occur exclusively in the floating regime, being zero in the fixed regime. Second, we show that fixed-to-floating regime shifts are associated with negative returns to a carry strategy implemented only on floating currencies, robust to the inclusion of volatility risks. These shifts are typically characterized by global flight-to-safety events that represent bad times for carry traders.
F31|Exchange Rate Undershooting: Evidence and Theory|We run local projections to estimate the effect of US monetary policy shocks on the dollar. We find that monetary contractions appreciate the dollar and establish two results. First, the spot exchange rate undershoots: the appreciation is smaller on impact than in the longer run. Second, forward exchange rates also appreciate on impact, but their response is flat across tenors. Next, we develop and estimate a New Keynesian model with information frictions. In the model, investors do not observe the natural rate of interest directly. As a result, they learn only over time whether an interest rate surprise represents a monetary contraction. The model accurately predicts the joint dynamics of spot and forward exchange rates following a monetary contraction.
F31|Covered Interest Parity Arbitrage|We show that it is crucial to account for the heterogeneity in funding costs, both across banks and across currency areas, in order to understand recently documented deviations from Covered Interest Parity (CIP). When CIP arbitrage is implemented accounting for marginal funding costs and realistic risk-free investment instruments, the no-arbitrage relation holds fairly well for the majority of market participants. A narrow set of global high-rated banks, however, does enjoy riskless arbitrage opportunities. Such arbitrage opportunities emerge as an equilibrium outcome as FX swap dealers set prices to avoid inventory imbalances. Low-rated banks find it attractive to turn to the FX swap market to cover their U.S. dollar funding, while swap dealers elicit opposite (arbitrage) flows by high-rated banks. Such arbitrage opportunities are difficult to scale, with funding rates adjusting as soon as arbitrageurs increase their positions.
F31|Monetary Systems and the Global Balance-of-Payments Adjustment in the Pre-Gold Standard Period, 1700-1870|We divide this paper into four sections. The first section outlines the taxonomy of commodity-based monetary regimes in Europe and their advantages and costs. The second section describes the main international monetary flows in the Early Modern period and relates them to East-West balance-of-trade adjustments and monetary systems in Asia (1700-1800). In the third section, we turn to the development of the foreign exchange market, which was mostly based on bills of exchange in this period. We explain the expansion of bills-of-exchange market from the European to the intercontinental network in the mid-19th century. The final section then investigates how nominal exchange rates and relative prices contributed to the global current account adjustments in the near pre-gold standard period (1820s-1870s).
F31|Trade and Worker Deskilling|This paper presents new evidence on international trade and worker outcomes. It examines a big world event that produced an unprecedentedly large shock to the UK exchange rate. In the 24 hours in June 2016 during which the UK electorate unexpectedly voted to leave the European Union, the value of sterling plummeted. It recorded the biggest depreciation that has occurred in any of the world's four major currencies since the collapse of Bretton Woods. Exploiting this variation, the paper studies the impact of trade on wages and worker training. Wages and training fell for workers employed in sectors where the intermediate import price rose by more as a consequence of the sterling depreciation. Calibrating the estimated wage elasticity with respect to intermediate import prices to theory uncovers evidence of a production complementarity between workers and intermediate imports. This provides new direct evidence that, in the modern world of global value chains, it is changes in the cost of intermediate imports that act as a driver of the impact of globalization on worker welfare. The episode studied and the findings add to widely expressed, growing concerns about poor productivity performance relating to skills and to patterns of real wage stagnation that are plaguing contemporary labour markets.
F31|Forward-Looking Policy Rules and Currency Premia|We evaluate the cross-sectional predictive ability of a forward-looking monetary policy reaction function, or Taylor rule, in both statistical and economic terms. We find that investors require a premium for holding currency portfolios with high implied interest rates while currency portfolios with low implied rates offer negative currency excess returns. Our forward-looking Taylor rule signals are orthogonal to current nominal interest rates and disconnected from carry trade portfolios and other currency investment strategies. The profitability of the Taylor rule portfolio spread is mainly driven by inflation forecasts rather than the output gap and is robust to data snooping and a wide range of robustness checks.
F31|Exportweltmeister: The Low Returns on Germany's Capital Exports|"Germany is world champion in exporting capital (\Exportweltmeister""). No other country invests larger amounts of savings outside its borders. However, Germany plays in the third division when it comes to investment performance, as we show in this paper. We study the returns on German foreign investments from 1950 to 2017 and find that: (1) Germany's annual returns on foreign assets were 2 to 5 percentage points lower than those of comparable countries. Germany ranks last among the G7 countries, also in the last decade; (2) Domestic returns on German assets have outperformed foreign returns abroad by about 3 percentage points per year; (3) Germany's external wealth provides very little consumption insurance as foreign returns are highly correlated with domestic activity; (4) The capital exports do little to diversify demographic risks as Germany mainly invests in countries with similar demographics. Taken together, these facts raise substantial doubts whether German households, firms, and banks allocate their savings in a beneficial way."
F31|Exchange Rate Reconnect|The failure to find fundamentals that co-move with exchange rates or forecasting models with even mild predictive power – facts broadly referred to as “exchange rate disconnect” – stands among the most disappointing, but robust, facts in all of international macroeconomics. In this paper, we demonstrate that U.S. purchases of foreign bonds, which did not co-move with exchange rates prior to 2007, have provided significant in-sample, and even some out-of-sample, explanatory power for currencies since then. We show that several proxies for global risk factors also start to co-move strongly with the dollar and with U.S. purchases of foreign bonds around 2007, suggesting that risk plays a key role in this finding. We use security-level data on U.S. portfolios to demonstrate that the reconnect of U.S. foreign bond purchases to exchange rates is largely driven by investment in dollar-denominated assets rather than by foreign currency exposure alone. Our results support the narrative emerging from an active recent literature that the US dollar’s role as an international and safe-haven currency has surged since the global financial crisis.
F31|Markets and Markups: A New Empirical Framework and Evidence on Exporters from China|We develop a new empirical framework to analyse destination-specific markup and quantity adjustments to bilateral exchange rates by exporters. The framework offers two methodological innovations. First, we develop an unbiased estimator of the markup elasticity that correctly isolates marginal costs in large unbalanced panels where the set of markets served by firms varies endogenously with currency movements. Second, we exploit Chinese linguistics to process characters recorded in Chinese custom forms to build a novel, general, product classification distinguishing high and low differentiation goods - which we can use to proxy for exporters' market power. Applying this framework to exporters from China over 2000-2014, we document substantial heterogeneity in destination-specific markup elasticities across product classes and firm types. Conditional on a price change, the average markup elasticity for highly differentiated consumption goods is 32%; markup adjustments explain three quarters of incomplete pass through into import prices for these goods. In contrast, the average for low-differentiation intermediates is only 5%, suggesting that pricing for these goods responds to global, rather than local, economic conditions. Markup elasticities are higher for both state-owned and foreign-invested enterprises than for private enterprises, which, on average, pursue aggressively competitive strategies throughout our sample.
F31|Cryptocurrencies, Currency Competition, and The Impossible Trinity|We analyze a two-country economy with complete markets, featuring two national currencies as well as a global (crypto)currency. If the global currency is used in both countries, the national nominal interest rates must be equal and the exchange rate between the national currencies is a risk- adjusted martingale. We call this result Crypto-Enforced Monetary Policy Synchronization (CEMPS). Deviating from interest equality risks approaching the zero lower bound or the abandonment of the national currency. If the global currency is backed by interest-bearing assets, additional and tight restrictions on monetary policy arise. Thus, the classic Impossible Trinity becomes even less reconcilable.
F31|Business Cycles and Currency Returns|We find a strong link between currency excess returns and the relative strength of the business cycle. Buying currencies of strong economies and selling currencies of weak economies generates high returns both in the cross section and time series of countries. These returns stem primarily from spot exchange rate predictability, are uncorrelated with common currency investment strategies, and cannot be understood using traditional currency risk factors in either unconditional or conditional asset pricing tests. We also show that a business cycle factor implied by our results is priced in a broad currency cross section.
F31|Access to Finance and the Exchange Rate Sensitivity of Exports|The recent empirical literature estimating the elasticity of exports to exchange-rate fluctuations has shown that, while devaluations have in general a positive effect on exports, the size of it varies significantly depending on firm, sector and country characteristics. In this paper we lend theoretical and empirical support to the view that the financial conditions of a firm have a relevant effect on the way in which exchange rate movements affect its export decisions. In particular, we show that exporting activities by more financially constrained firms are more sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations than those by firms with a better ability to raise external capital. This finding is detected at both the intensive and extensive margin of export. Consistent with the result on export quantities, we also document that the exchange rate pass-through to export prices denominated in the domestic currency is lower for firms facing stronger financial constraints. Moreover, we show that our results are robust to controlling for a variety of alternative features that may affect the firm-level elasticity of exports to exchange-rate, such as the intensity of use of imported inputs, labor productivity, the degree of price stickiness and firm size.
F31|Accumulation of foreign currency reserves and risk-taking|We assess whether the accumulation of foreign currency reserves in the Asia-Pacific region may have unintended consequences in the form of increased private sector risk-taking. To do so we carry out a country-specific daily data event study analysis of the relationship between official announcements of reserves stocks and various proxy measures of risk-taking. Overall, our results suggest that reserves accumulation exerts no significant influence on risk-taking.
F31|Who Is Successful in Foreign Exchange Margin Trading? New Survey Evidence from Japan|We use a 2018 survey of FX margin traders in Japan to investigate which key factors influence their performance: socio-demographic and economic situation, investment strategy and trading behaviour, and/or financial literacy. First, the data show that variables from all three groups are significant predictors of traders’ performance. Second, we find that older traders and those without a specific trading strategy demonstrate lower performance. Performance is higher for those who trade greater amounts, rely more on fundamental analysis, and report having profitable FX trade skills. Third, respondents’ subjectively stated claim of having FX trade skills is based on a more advanced understanding of FX trading and a reliance on professional advice. Neither objective financial knowledge nor over/underconfidence play a noteworthy role in the performance of margin traders.
F31|Currency Collapses and Output Dynamics in Commodity Dependent Countries|This paper provides new empirical evidence on the relationship between currency collapses (i.e. large nominal depreciations or devaluations) and real output by paying a specific attention to commodity exporting countries. Using a dataset including 108 emerging and developing economies for the period 1970-2016, we document and estimate what happens to output growth during episodes of currency collapses for commodity-dependent and non commodity-dependent countries. One particular feature of our analysis is to control for war events. We find that currency crises occur more frequently in commodity-dependent countries (one crisis every 17 years versus 30 years for non commodity-dependent countries) and with a larger magnitude (median depreciation about 12 percent points larger for commodity-dependent countries). In both groups of countries, output growth declines in response to the currency collapse. It appears however that output growth starts to slowdown earlier in commodity-dependent countries while the impact is more persistent in non commodity-dependent countries. The magnitude of the output growth slowdown is very close between the two groups of countries. Finally, we find that the output growth-currency collapse relationship differs among commodity-dependent countries according to the category of their main exported commodity.
F31|Modelling returns and volatility connectedness between food prices and exchange rate in Nigeria|This study measures the connectedness between food prices and exchange rate in Nigeria using the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) approach. Using weekly data from January 2012 to January 2019 on five major food prices â€“ rice, maize, millet gari and sorghum, and naira to dollar exchange rate, the study tests for spillovers transmission between food prices and Nigeria domestic currency against the most traded foreign currency - US dollar. The paper finds evidence of interdependence among the food prices and exchange rate based on the obtained spillover indexes. The study further accounts for the 2016 naira to dollar exchange rate crash. The results show that the huge depreciation in the exchange rate have a greater spillover effects on the food prices with this finding is robust to varying lag structure and VAR lag order.
F31|Exchange rate pass-through to import prices: Accounting for changes in the Eurozone trade structure|This paper assesses whether the emergence of new trading partners (i.e., China and Eastern Europe) as suppliers reduces the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) in Eurozone countries which differ regarding their external exposure. Using bilateral data on import prices at the two-digit sector level, we find that (i) pass-through is complete in many cases, (ii) ERPT from China is higher than from the United States, and (iii) there is no compelling evidence of a generalized link between ERPT and the increasing integration of some emerging markets in European imports. We also show that the launch of the single currency has not provoked a sufficient change in the part of trade exposed to exchange rate fluctuations and, therefore, has not affected the pass-through. Overall, the trend of liberalization in new players' markets has not altered the competitive environment such as to induce exporters of other countries to absorb exchange rate depreciations.
F31|Exchange rate volatility and cooperation in an incomplete markets' economy|In this paper, we contribute to the debate on whether exchange rate volatility is detrimental or not for welfare by characterizing optimal monetary policies in a two-country OLG model where markets are incomplete. The equilibrium nominal exchange rate is volatile as a result of shocks against which agents are not able to insure. In a non-cooperative environment, central banks have an incentive to devaluate the domestic currency by giving monetary transfers to domestic agents. However, such policies result in higher exchange rate volatility. We show that cooperation reduces exchange rate volatility as: (1) the negative spillover effects due to the expansionary monetary policies are internalized; (2) cooperative policies smooth the effects of shocks to fundamentals on the exchange rate. For standard parameter values, the gains from cooperation are not negligible. However, for cooperation to be Pareto improving countries should be weighted differently in the social welfare function. This could explain the lack of cooperation across countries, instead of the negligible gains as previously argued.
F31|Financial stability assessment for EU candidate countries and potential candidates|This paper reviews and assesses financial stability challenges in countries preparing for EU membership, i.e. Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey. The paper mainly focuses on the period since 2016 (unless the analysis requires a longer time span) and on the banking sectors that dominate financial systems in this group of countries. For the Western Balkans, the paper analyses recent trends in financial intermediation, as well as the two main challenges that have been identified in the past. Asset quality continues to improve, but the share of non-performing loans is still high in some countries, while regulatory, legal and tax impediments are still to be resolved in most cases. High unofficial euroisation is a source of indirect credit risk for countries with their own national legal tender, which calls for continued efforts to promote the use of domestic currencies in the financial system. At the same time, banking systems seem less prone to financial stress from maturity mismatches than certain EU peers. These risks are met with a solid shock-absorbing capacity in the Western Balkans, as exemplified by robust capital and liquidity buffers. Turkey experienced a period of heightened financial stress during 2018 and, while its banking system appears to have sufficient buffers to absorb shocks overall, significant forex borrowing of corporates and high rollover needs of banks in foreign exchange on the wholesale market constitute considerable financial stability risks.

F31|The global capital flows cycle: structural drivers and transmission channels|In this paper, we study the effects of structural shocks that influence global risk – the main factor behind a “global capital flows cycle” – and how risk, in turn, is transmitted to capital flows. Our results show that not all the risk shocks driving the global financial cycle have the same effects on capital flows. Changes in global risk caused by pure financial shocks have the largest impact on the global configuration of capital flows, followed by US monetary policy shocks. As regards the transmission of risk to capital flows, we uncover a traditional “trilemma”, as countries more financially open and adopting a strict peg are more sensitive to global risk. This “trilemma” is mainly driven by one category of cross-border flows, “other investment”, confirming the importance of cross-border banking loans in the narrative of the global financial cycle.

F31|Fast Trading and the Virtue of Entropy: Evidence from the Foreign Exchange Market|Focusing on the foreign exchange reaction to macroeconomic announcements, we show that fast trading is positively and significantly correlated with the entropy of the distribution of quoted prices in reaction to news: a larger share of fast trading increases the degree of diversity of quotes in the order book, for given liquidity, order book depth and size of order flows. Exploiting the WM Reuters’ reform of the fixing methodology in February 2015 as a natural experiment, we provide evidence that fast trading raises entropy, rather than reacting to it. While more entropy in quoted prices means noisier information and arguably complicates price discovery from an individual trader’s perspective, we show that, in the aggregate, more entropy actually brings traded prices closer to the random walk hypothesis, and improves indicators of market efficiency and quality of trade execution. We estimate that a 10 percent increase in entropy reduces the negative impact of macro news by over 60% for effective spreads, against over 40% for realized spreads and price impacts. Our findings suggest that the main mechanism by which fast trading may have desirable effects on market performance specifically hinges on enhanced heterogeneity in trading patterns, best captured by entropy.
F31|Housing Cycle and Exchange Rates|This paper documents that U.S. housing capital investment is a strong negative predictor of U.S. dollar changes and excess returns over the next six months to five years. Other advanced economies exhibit similar patterns. Moreover, positive housing supply shocks predict lower prices of housing services and nontradables relative to that of tradables, as well as higher output growth and macroeconomic volatility. An analytical model shows that these channels generate the exchange rate predictability under incomplete and complete markets, respectively. Cross-sectionally, currencies with higher loadings on the U.S. housing cycle carry higher average currency premia, compensating the U.S. investor for bearing the U.S. long-run consumption risk.
F31|Trade and deskilling: how the post-referendum sterling depreciation hurt workers|The unexpected result of the Brexit referendum, working through the rapid depreciation of sterling, had a sizable negative impact on UK workers. New CEP work by Rui Costa, Swati Dhingra and Stephen Machin shows that the big drop in the value of the pound caused a rise in import prices, which has led to a fall in both wages and training for employees in the most heavily hit sectors.
F31|Vehicle Currency Pricing and Exchange Rate Pass-Through|Using detailed firm-level transactions data for UK imports, this paper studies the relationship between invoicing currency choices and the response of import prices to exchange rate changes. We find that for transactions invoiced in a vehicle currency, import prices are much more sensitive to changes in the vehicle currency than in the bilateral exchange rate. Aggregate pass-through therefore substantially increases once we account for vehicle currencies. We also show how this translates into higher pass-through for UK consumer prices, in particular during the Great Recession and in the period following the Brexit referendum. Finally, we develop a theoretical framework to conceptualize exchange rate pass-through in the context of vehicle currency pricing. Overall, our results contribute to understanding the exchange rate disconnect puzzle, and have implications for the setting of monetary policy.
F31|Political Risk and Real Exchange Rate: What can we Learn from Recent Developments in Panel Data Econometrics for Emerging and Developing Countries?|This paper focuses on the analysis of the long-run response of the Real Exchange Rate (RER) to political risks and tests whether non-economic variables have an impact on RER in 31 emerging and developing countries. We use annual data from the International Country Risk Guide database over the 1984 to 2016 period. Based on the recently developed method of Cross- Sectionally Augmented ARDL approach of Chudik and Pesaran (2015b), and the panel threshold estimation of Chudik et al. (2017) our main findings are the following: i) countries experiencing a high degree of corruption, a high risk to investment, or a high degree of political instability tend to experience a real exchange rate depreciation, ii) there exists strong evidence for a threshold effect on the relationship between investment profile-RER, corruption-RER and political instability-RER. Specifically, political instability and corruption adversely affect real exchange rate especially when they exceed the threshold. iii) the effects of bureaucracy, law, and order seem to be statistically insignificant on the RER. Our findings are robust to the inclusion of the Balassa-Samuelson effect in the estimated equations.
F31|A Tale of Two Surplus Countries: China and Germany|We analyze current account imbalances through the lens of the two largest surplus countries; China and Germany. We observe two striking patterns visible since the 2007/8 Global Financial Crisis. First, while China has been gradually reducing its current account surplus, Germany’s surplus has continued to increase throughout and after the crisis. Second, for these two countries, there is a remarkable reversal in the patterns of exchange rate misalignment: China’s currency has turned from being undervalued to overvalued, Germany’s currency has erased its level of overvaluation and become undervalued. Our empirical analyses show that the current account balances of these two countries are quite well explained by currency misalignment, common economic factors, and country-specific factors. Furthermore, we highlight the global financial crisis effects and, for Germany, the importance of differentiating balances against euro and non-euro countries.
F31|The Euro Crisis and Economic Growth: A Novel Counterfactual Approach|Macroeconomic adjustment in the euro area periphery was more recessionary than pre-crisis imbalances would have warranted. To make this claim, this paper uses a Propensity Score Matching Model to produce counterfactuals for the Eurozone crisis countries (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Cyprus, Spain) based on over 200 past macroeconomic adjustment episodes between 1960-2010 worldwide. At its trough, between 2010 and 2015 per capita GDP had contracted on average 11 percentage points more in the Eurozone periphery than in the standard counterfactual scenario. These results are not dictated by any specific country experience, are robust to a battery of alternative counterfactual definitions, and stand confirmed when using a parametric dynamic panel regression model to account more thoroughly for the business cycle. Zooming in on the potential causes, the lack of an independent monetary policy, while having contributed to a deeper recession, does not fully explain the Eurozone’s specificity, which is instead to be traced back to a sharper-than-expected contraction in investment and fiscal austerity due to high funding costs.
F31|Total, asymmetric and frequency connectedness between oil and forex markets|We analyze total, asymmetric and frequency connectedness between oil and forex markets using high-frequency, intra-day data over the period 2007 -- 2017. By employing variance decompositions and their spectral representation in combination with realized semivariances to account for asymmetric and frequency connectedness, we obtain interesting results. We show that divergence in monetary policy regimes affects forex volatility spillovers but that adding oil to a forex portfolio decreases the total connectedness of the mixed portfolio. Asymmetries in connectedness are relatively small. While negative shocks dominate forex volatility connectedness, positive shocks prevail when oil and forex markets are assessed jointly. Frequency connectedness is largely driven by uncertainty shocks and to a lesser extent by liquidity shocks, which impact long-term connectedness the most and lead to its dramatic increase during periods of distress.
F31|A Jackknife Model Averaging Analysis of RMB Misalignment Estimates|We adopt the Jackknife Model Averaging (JMA) technique to conduct a meta-regression analysis of 925 renminbi (RMB) misalignment estimates generated by 69 studies. The JMA method accounts for model selection and sampling uncertainties, and allows for non-nested model specifications and heteroskedasticity in assessing effects of study characteristics. The RMB misalignment estimates are found to be systematically affected by the choices of data, the theoretical setup and the empirical strategy, in addition to publication attributes of these studies. These study characteristic effects are quite robust to the choice of benchmark study characteristics, to alternative model averaging methods including the heteroskedasticity-robust Mallows approach, the information criterion approach, and the Bayesian model averaging. In evaluating the probabilistic property of RMB misalignment estimates implied by hypothetical composites of study characteristics, we find the evidence of a misaligned RMB, in general, is weak.
F31|Actualización de la estimación de los indicadores “Razón Precio–Cuenta”|La estimación de las razones de precio – cuenta (RPC) permite valorar los insumos y productos de un proyecto de inversión en términos sociales, mediante la transformación de los flujos financieros en flujos económicos. En 1990 se calculó las RPC para Colombia por primera vez y desde entonces no se ha elaborado una actualización de dichos indicadores, por esto surge la necesidad de hacer este ejercicio con nuevas estimaciones que tengan en cuenta los nuevos datos de la economía del país. La actualización de las estimaciones de las RPC se enfocó en el marco de la matriz insumo – producto de 2014 y los resultados obtenidos evidenciaron una estructura de costos de los insumos sustancialmente diferente a la obtenida en las estimaciones de 1990.
F31|Estimación del precio – cuenta de la mano de obra|En el presente estudio se quiere hacer una actualización del cálculo del precio – cuenta de la mano de obra en Colombia. Para esto se hace una caracterización del mercado laboral, obteniendo las clases de mano de obra sobre las cuales hacer los cálculos, que son el sector calificado y no calificado urbano y el sector rural. Se encuentra que las distorsiones son bastantes importantes, y se reflejan, particularmente, en la mano de obra no calificad urbana y la del sector rural.
F31|Determinants of real exchange rate movements in 15 emerging market economies|No abstract is available for this item.
F31|Price discovery in cryptocurrency markets|We ask which markets drive bitcoin prices and how price discovery happens across different exchanges. Does the greater exuberance for cryptocurrencies outside the United States affect prices only on local markets or does it impact price formation on global cryptocurrency markets? We document significant heterogeneity in which price formation happens across exchanges and time. When markets are more integrated, shocks to prices on all exchanges contribute to price discovery. However, when markets become segmented, those exchanges that have large arbitrage spreads relative to the US price, i.e. where investors are more exuberant become much less important for price discovery.
F31|The Purchasing Power Parity Puzzle: An Update|We show that the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) puzzle, whereby the half-life of the shock to the real exchange rate is long and unjustifiable by monetary and financial shocks, is a result of specification and estimation issues. We provide an alternative specification for PPP and show that the half-life of the shock could be as short as 6.8 months and as long as 2 years, which is considerably shorter than what have been reported in the literature.
F31|Nonlinear Relationship between Exchange Rate Volatility and Economic Growth|In this paper, we challenge the traditional assumption of a linear relationship between exchange rate volatility and economic growth in South Africa. By using data collected from 1970 to 2016 applied to a smooth transition regression (STR) model, we are able to prove that the exchange rate-economic growth correlation is indeed nonlinear within the sampled time period. In particular, we find that regime switching behaviour is facilitated by government size in which exchange rate volatility positively and significantly influences economic growth when growth in government spending is below 6 percent. Above this 6 percent threshold, volatility exerts an insignificant effect on economic growth. In light of the adoption of a free floating exchange rate regime by the Reserve Bank, our results emphasize the importance of the role which fiscal authorities play on the extent to which exchange rate movements affect economic growth.
F31|Self-selection and treatment effects in macroeconomics: Revisiting the effectiveness of foreign exchange intervention|Along the lines of the treatment effects literature, this paper empirically revisits the issue of the so-called “intervention effect”, i.e., the effectiveness of official foreign exchange intervention on the movement of the exchange rate. We extended in a continuous treatment setting the inverse probability weights estimator developed by Jorda and Taylor (2015) and Angrist, Jorda and Kuersteiner (forthcoming) to control for self-selection bias. We then illustrate the application of this technique by examining the effectiveness of official daily interventions by Japanese monetary authorities in the JPY/USD market. In accordance with existing evidence using this intervention data, this paper finds that periods of intervention characterized by large, infrequent and sporadic interventions are effective in moving the changes in the exchange rate in the desired direction. We also find evidence that the intervention effect does not last longer than two days after the intervention takes place.
F31|The Quanto Theory of Exchange Rates|We present a new identity that relates expected exchange rate appreciation to a risk-neutral covariance term, and use it to motivate a currency forecasting variable based on the prices of quanto index contracts. We show via panel regressions that the quanto forecast variable is an economically and statistically significant predictor of currency appreciation and of excess returns on currency trades. Out of sample, the quanto variable outperforms predictions based on uncovered interest parity, on purchasing power parity, and on a random walk as a forecaster of differential (dollar-neutral) currency appreciation.
F31|Evaluating India’s exchange rate regime under global shocks| The paper assesses the performance of India’s managed float with respect to maintaining a real competitive exchange rate, its impact on trade, on stability of currency and financial markets, and on inflation. It also derives the current range that balances these three effects.
F31|Methodologies for the Assessment of Current Account Benchmarks|This paper describes two methodologies to compute benchmarks for current account balances. The first benchmark helps to assess the implications of current account balances for the Net International Investment Position (NIIP). These NIIP-stabilising benchmarks are the current account/GDP ratios required to stabilise the stock of net external liabilities at their current levels, or for the NIIP to reach a pre-specified prudential target. The second benchmark computes current account norms which represent current account balances that are in line with economic fundamentals. This benchmark is obtained from the estimation of an empirical model for current accounts based on annual data from a panel of 65 advanced and emerging economies following a methodology akin to Phillips et al. (2013). Current account norms are computed as the prediction from the model restricted to explanatory factors that can be considered as fundamentals, i.e. non-temporary economic factors and policy-related variables at ‘normal’ (world-average) level. The first two benchmarks provide complementary information in assessing current account positions: the NIIPstabilising current account permits the implications of stock imbalances to be assessed from a prudential perspective; while current account norms allow deviations from economic fundamentals over the mediumto-long term to be evaluated.
F31|What Multiscale Approach Can Tell About the Nexus Between Exchange Rate and Stocks in the Major Emerging Markets?|This paper tries to answer which theory – the portfolio balance approach or the flow-oriented model, better explains the nexus between the national stock and exchange rate markets at different time-horizons in the major emerging markets of Europe and Asia. For that task we employ wavelet coherence and phase difference. Wavelet coherence results suggest that correlation between the two markets is not particularly strong throughout the observed period and at different wavelet scales, except in the period of World financial crisis (WFC). Phase difference in the Czech Republic, Turkey, Poland, Russia and South Korea are in anti-phase position during WFC in short run, which is in accordance with the portfolio-balance approach, whereby the stock market has the leading role. Also, phase difference at longer time-horizon indicate that an anti-phase situation is relatively common phenomenon in Poland, Russia, Turkey and South Korea. However, when we do calculations on real values, the results suggest that the real stock returns and the real exchange rate changes overwhelmingly behave in line with the flow-oriented model in all emerging markets, except for Poland. As for the Czech and Indian cases, phase differences indicate that the markets behave predominantly in accordance with the flow-oriented model at long-term horizon, regardless of whether nominal or real values are used.
F31|Currency Risk Factors in a Recursive Multi-Country Economy|Focusing on the ten most-traded currencies, we provide empirical evidence about a significant heterogenous exposure to global growth news shocks. We incorporate this empirical fact in a frictionless risk-sharing model with recursive preferences, multiple countries, and multiple consumption goods whose supply features both global and local short- and long-run shocks. Since news shocks are priced, heterogenous exposure to global long-lasting growth shocks results in a relevant reallocation of international resources and currency adjustments. Our unified framework replicates the properties of the HML-FX and HML-NFA carry trade strategies studied by Lustig et al. (2011) and Della Corte et al. (2013).
F31|Global Financial Cycles and the Exchange Rate Regime: A Perspective from Emerging Markets|This paper examines the claim that exchange rate regimes are of little relevance in the transmission of global financial conditions to domestic financial and macroeconomic conditions. Our findings suggest that exchange rate regimes do matter, at least for emerging market economies. The transmission of global financial shocks to domestic variables is magnified under fixed exchange rate regimes relative to more flexible regimes. For advanced economies, however, the jury is still out, as the recent paucity of truly fixed regimes among these economies poses a challenge for estimating the effect of exchange rate flexibility.
F31|BKK the EZ Way. International Long-Run Growth News and Capital Flows|We study the response of international investment flows to short- and long-run growth news. Among developed G7 countries, positive long-run news for domestic productivity induces a net outflow of investments, in contrast to the effects of short-run growth shocks. We document that a standard Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1994) (BKK) model fails to reproduce this novel empirical evidence. We augment this model with Epstein and Zin (1989) preferences (EZ-BKK) and characterize the resulting recursive risk-sharing scheme. The response of international capital flows in the EZ-BKK model is consistent with the data.
F31|Multihorizon Currency Returns and Purchasing Power Parity|Exposures of expected future depreciation rates to the current interest rate differential violate the UIP hypothesis in a distinctive pattern that is a non-monotonic function of horizon. Conversely, forward, or risk-adjusted expected depreciation rates are monotonic. We explain the two patterns jointly by incorporating the weak form of PPP, aka stationarity of the real exchange rate, into a joint model of the stochastic discount factor, the nominal exchange rate, inflation differential, domestic and foreign yield curves. Short-term departures from PPP generate the first pattern. The risk premiums for these departures generate the second pattern. Thus, the variance of the stochastic discount factor must be related to the real exchange rate deepening the exchange rate disconnect.
F31|The real exchange rate, innovation and productivity : regional heterogeneity, asymmetries and hysteresis|We evaluate manufacturing firms' responses to changes in the real exchange rate (RER) using detailed firm-level data for a large set of countries for the period 2001-2010. We uncover the following stylized facts: In export-oriented emerging Asia, real depreciations are associated with faster growth of firm-level TFP, higher sales and cash-flow, and higher probabilities to engage in R&D and to export. We find negative effects for firms in other emerging economies, which are relatively more import dependent, and no significant effects for firms in industrialized economies. Motivated by these facts, we build a dynamic model in which real depreciations raise the cost of importing intermediates, affect demand, borrowing-constraints and the profitability of engaging in innovation (R&D). We decompose the effects of RER changes on productivity growth across regions into these channels. We estimate the model and quantitatively evaluate the different mechanisms by providing counterfactual simulations of temporary RER movements and conduct several robustness analyses. Effects on physical TFP growth, while different across regions, are non-linear and asymmetric.
F31|Uncertainty and Hyperinflation: European Inflation Dynamics after World War I|Fiscal deficits, elevated debt-to-GDP ratios, and high inflation rates suggest hyperinflation could have potentially emerged in many European countries after World War I. We demonstrate that economic policy uncertainty was instrumental in pushing a subset of European countries into hyperinflation shortly after the end of the war. Germany, Austria, Poland, and Hungary (GAPH) suffered from frequent uncertainty shocks – and correspondingly high levels of uncertainty – caused by protracted political negotiations over reparations payments, the apportionment of the Austro-Hungarian debt, and border disputes. In contrast, other European countries exhibited lower levels of measured uncertainty between 1919 and 1925, allowing them more capacity with which to implement credible commitments to their fiscal and monetary policies. Impulse response functions show that increased uncertainty caused a rise in inflation contemporaneously and for a few months afterward in GAPH, but this effect was absent or much more limited for the other European countries in our sample. Our results suggest that elevated economic uncertainty directly affected inflation dynamics and the incidence of hyperinflation during the interwar period.
F31|The Term Structure of Redenomination Risk|This paper assesses redenomination risk in the euro area. We first estimate daily default-risk-free yield curves for French, German, and Italian bonds that can be redenominated and for bonds that cannot. Then, we extract the compensation for redenomination risk from the yield spreads between these two types of bonds. Redenomination risk primarily shows up at the short end of yield curves. At the height of the euro crisis, spreads between first-year yields were close to 7% for Italy and up to -2% for Germany. The ECB's interventions designed to reduce the risk of a breakup successfully did so for Italy, but increased it for France and Germany.
F31|Model-Free International Stochastic Discount Factors|We provide a theoretical characterization of international stochastic discount factors (SDFs) in incomplete markets under different degrees of market segmentation. Using 40 years of data on a cross-section of countries, we estimate model-free SDFs and factorize them into permanent and transitory components. We find that large permanent SDF components help to reconcile the low exchange rate volatility, the exchange rate cyclicality, and the forward premium anomaly. However, integrated markets entail highly volatile and almost perfectly comoving international SDFs. In contrast, segmented markets can generate less volatile and more dissimilar SDFs. In quest of relating the SDFs to economic fundamentals, we document strong links between proxies of financial intermediaries' risk-bearing capacity and model-free international SDFs. We interpret this evidence through the lens of an economy with two building blocks: limited participation by households and financiers who face an intermediation friction.
F31|An intermediation-based model of exchange rates|We develop a general equilibrium model with intermediaries at the heart of international financial markets. In our model, intermediaries bargain with their customers and extract rents for providing access to foreign claims. The behavior of intermediaries, by tilting state prices, generates an explicit, non-linear risk structure in exchange rates. We show how this endogenous risk structure helps explain a number of anomalies in foreign exchange and international capital markets, including the safe haven properties of exchange rates and the breakdown of covered interest parity.
F31|Nominal exchange rate dynamics and monetary policy: uncovered interest rate parity and purchasing power parity revisited|The increasing globalization of trade in goods and services and the deepening of financial markets have reduced frictions that may impede the operation of the PPP and UIP relationships in the short run. In this paper, we estimate the short term relative PPP and UIP relationships. Using data from Israel, which has a deep market for inflation expectations for 12 months, we show that relative PPP and UIP cannot be rejected. Deviations from equilibrium last less than a year. Data from Israel's capital account of the balance of payments shows that the deviations are not destabilizing. Our findings suggest that greater globalization and financial deepening contribute to the effectiveness of monetary policy.
F31|Global Investors, the Dollar, and U.S. Credit Conditions|This paper documents that an appreciation of the U.S. dollar is associated with a reduction in the supply of commercial and industrial loans by U.S. banks. An increase in the broad dollar index by 2.5 points (one standard deviation) reduces U.S. banks’ corporate loan originations by 10 percent. This decline is driven by a reduction in the demand for loans on the secondary market where prices fall and liquidity worsens when the dollar appreciates, with stronger effects for riskier loans. Today, the main buyers of U.S. corporate loans—and, hence, suppliers of funding for these loans—are institutional investors, in particular mutual funds, which experience outflows when the dollar appreciates. A shift of traditional financial intermediation to these relatively unregulated entities, which are more sensitive to global developments, has led to the emergence of this new channel through which the dollar affects the U.S. economy, which we term the secondary market channel.
F31|International Yield Curves and Currency Puzzles|The depreciation rate is often computed as the ratio of foreign and domestic pricing kernels. Using bond prices alone to estimate these kernels leads to currency puzzles: the inability of models to match violations of uncovered interest parity and the volatility of exchange rates. One cannot use information in bonds alone because exchange rates are not spanned by bonds. This view of the puzzles is distinct from market incompleteness. Incorporating exchange rates into estimation of yield curve models helps with resolving the puzzles. It also allows us to connect the differences between international yield curves to characteristics of exchange rates.
F31|The effect of exchange rate shocks on firm-level exports: evidence from the Brexit vote|This paper exploits the abrupt and sharp depreciation of the British Pound after the Brexit referendum as a quasi-natural experiment to investigate the effect of exchange rate shocks on export quantity, price, entry and exit. We use transaction-level export data for the universe of exporters in Portugal. Using monthly observations on export quantity and price for the same firm exporting the same product to buyers in the UK and in other countries, allows us to cleanly identify the differential response to the shock for the UK market, relative to other markets. We find that exporters reduced their mark-up in the UK market after the referendum shock. Our estimates imply a large pricing-to-market coefficient and exchange rate pass-through. Exporters that are more productive adjust their mark-ups by more after the exchange rate shock, and have lower pass-through. There is more pricing-to-market for consumer goods than for intermediate inputs. Within the same firm-product, export quantity to the UK also decreased after the shock. The referendum shock reduced the rate of export entry to the UK market by Portuguese firms and the probability of their continuing to export in the UK.
F31|Invoicing and Pricing-to-Market - A Study of Price and Markup Elasticities of UK Exporters|In this paper, we provide novel micro evidence that the currency in which exports and imports are invoiced is a good proxy for the currency in which Firms set prices. Using detailed data on UK customs transactions, we document that destination-specific markup adjustment is substantial only for export shipments which are invoiced in the destination market's currency, consistent with the view that Firms invoicing in local currency price to market. Conversely, we Find no destination-specific markup adjustments by Firms that invoice a shipment in either their own currency or a vehicle currency, consistent with a Firm setting one price either in their own or in a vehicle currency. However, we also document that, while the aggregate shares of invoicing currencies for the UK's exports and imports are stable over time, there is substantial heterogeneity at the Firm-product-destination level. A Firm's shipments of the same product to the same destination are often invoiced in multiple currencies, with a non-trivial degree of switching from one invoicing currency to another within a twelve-month period. This is more pronounced for Firms that are multi-product and serve several destinations, pointing to a potentially important margin of adjustment so far understudied in the literature.
F31|Volatility Risk Pass-Through|We develop a novel measure of volatility pass-through to assess international propagation of output volatility shocks to macroeconomic aggregates, equity prices, and currencies. An increase in country's output volatility is associated with a decrease in its output, consumption, and net exports. The average consumption pass-through is 50% (a 1% increase in output volatility increases consumption volatility by 0.5%) and it increases to 70% for shocks originating in smaller countries. The equity volatility pass-through is 90%, whereas the link between volatility of currency and fundamentals is weak. A novel channel of risk sharing of volatility risks can explain our empirical findings.
F31|Money Markets and Exchange Rates in Pre-Industrial Europe|This chapter focuses on money markets and exchange rates in preindustrial Europe. The foreign exchange market was mostly based on bills of exchange, the instrument used to transfer money and provide credit between distant centers in pre-industrial Europe. In this chapter, first I explain bill of exchange operations, money market integration, usury regulations and circumventions to hide the market interest rate as well as the evolution of bills of exchange in history, focusing mainly on the most relevant features generalized during the first half of the 17th century: endorsement and the joint liability rule, which facilitated the full expansion of the foreign exchange market beyond personal networks. Then, I describe the European geography of money in the mid-18th century, characterized by a very high degree of multilateralism with the triangle of Amsterdam, London and Paris as the backbone of the European settlement system. Finally, I measure the cost of capital and relate it to liquidity. I show evidence of interest rates in the 18th century for Amsterdam, London, Paris and Cadiz. While Amsterdam, London and Paris presented low and similar interest rates, Cadiz had higher interest rates, mostly being double the cost of capital. These results seem to show a high inverse correlation between liquidity and interest rates, suggesting that the share in international trade of European centers might have been a powerful driver of international monetary leadership. While more empirical evidence and further research is needed, this approach opens the scope of the analysis beyond the national institutional explanation.
F31|Liquidity and Exchange Rates: An Empirical Investigation|We find strong empirical evidence that economic fundamentals can well account for nominal exchange rate movements. The important innovation is that we include the liquidity yield on government bonds as an explanatory variable. We find impressive evidence that changes in the liquidity yield are significant in explaining exchange rate changes for all of the G10 countries. Moreover, after controlling for liquidity yields, traditional determinants of exchange rates – adjustment toward purchasing power parity and monetary shocks – are also found to be economically and statistically significant. We show how these relationships arise out of a canonical two-country New Keynesian model with liquidity returns. Additionally, we find a role for sovereign default risk and currency swap market frictions.
F31|The Rise of the Dollar and Fall of the Euro as International Currencies|International currencies play important roles as foreign exchange reserves but are also most frequently used to denominate corporate and government bonds, bank loans, and import and export invoices. These currencies offer unrivaled liquidity, constituting large shares of the volume on global foreign exchange markets, and are commonly chosen as the anchors targeted by countries with pegged or managed exchange rate regimes. We provide evidence suggesting a recent rise in the use of the dollar, and fall of the use of the euro, with similar patterns manifesting across all these aspects of international currency use.
F31|Gold price and exchange rates: A panel smooth transition regression model for the G7 countries|In this paper we investigate whether the price of gold is affected by internal and external macroeconomic performance, which is mainly reflected in exchange rate movements. Based on the G7 countries and using annual data for the period 1980–2016, we test the impact of the effective exchange rate and the interest rate on the price of gold. Departing from previous studies, we propose that the observed exchange rate should be taken into account in accordance with the equilibrium value of the currency and the implied misalignment. Τhe equilibrium real effective exchange rate is estimated using recent panel cointegration techniques, which are strengthened with the theoretical assumptions of an external balance model. Next, we estimate a two-regime Panel Smooth Transition Regression model with a monotonic transition function to capture the nonlinear dependency between the gold price and the macroeconomic variables. Our results show that investors tend to invest in gold as the misalignment rate of the real effective exchange rate increases. Furthermore, when the interest rate increase is rather high, investors are less willing to sell gold for higher return assets. Overall, our evidence confirms that gold serves as a hedge only when financial risk is high.
F31|Could this be a fiction? Bitcoin forecasts most tradable currency pairs better than ARFIMA|In this paper, we attempt to exploit any inherent useful information in Bitcoin to predict the future path of the most tradable currency pairs in the world. We also verify whether the forecast outcomes can compare favourably with the time series model such as the fractionally integrated autoregressive moving average (ARFIMA) model. We follow the Lewellen (2004) and Westerlund and Narayan (2102, 2015) approaches that account for any statistical effect that could bias the regression estimates. Our results suggest that Bitcoin is a good predictor of the selected currency pairs and more importantly, its forecast results outperform the time series model judging by the Diebold and Mariano test regardless of the data sample and forecast horizon. Although, recent evidence in the literature seems to suggest that the Bitcoin bubble will soon burst, its connection with the considered currency pairs may be exploited while it lasts.
F31|Predicting exchange rate with commodity prices: The role of structural breaks and asymmetries|In this paper, we offer new evidence on the predictability of exchange rate with commodity prices by accounting for the role of asymmetries and structural breaks. In particular, we evaluate whether such considerations matter for the forecast performance of the predictive model for exchange rate. We further account for any possible bias in estimation due to the presence of persistence, endogeneity and conditional heteroscedasticity effects in our predictors. Monthly data of five major tradable currency pairs in the world and disaggregated commodity price indices over the period of 1960 to 2017 are utilized. We find significant improvements in both the in-sample and out-of-sample forecast performance of the predictive model for exchange rate when asymmetries and structural breaks are accommodated. In addition, all the economic models considered with and without asymmetries and structural breaks offer superior forecast performance over the ARFIMA model. Our results are robust to alternative exchange rates and commodity price indices and different breaks, data samples and forecast horizons.
F31|Exchange rate dynamics and stock market performance in Nigeria: Evidence from a Nonlinear ARDL Approach|This study investigates asymmetry in the impact of exchange rate on the Nigerian stock market using Nonlinear ARDL model by Shin et al. (2014), and it is the first study to do so. From the trend review, changes in the dynamics of exchange rate - stock market relationship was noticed, and this was accounted for using Bai and Perron (2003) multiple structural breaks test. Empirical findings from this study reveal that there is long run but no short run exchange rate asymmetry effect on the Nigerian stock market. Furthermore, the results suggest that banking sector recapitalization only affects the short run dynamics of stock â€“ market exchange rate relationship. By implication, the Nigerian stock market adjust spontaneous or becomes more volatile after banking sector recapitalization. The policy implication from this study is that exchange rate policy cannot be used to correct short run disequilibrium in the Nigerian stock market, as it takes long term for the market to respond to changes in exchange rate. This is regardless of whether the policy being introduced is a revaluation or a devaluation policy.
F31|Estimating a Latent Risk Premium in Exchange Rate Futures|Using exchange rates futures instead of forwards completes the maturity spectrum of the correlation between the spot return and the premium. The correlation decreases with increasing maturity, presumably due to a latent risk premium. We hypothesize that the influence of the unobserved risk factor has a contract-specific risk component. Our main contribution is to control for the omitted variable bias by using a modified version of the CCE panel estimator in combination with futures data. This renders the coefficient on the futures premium insignificantly different from one. Subsequently, the contract-specific part is related to conventional proxies of risk.
F31|The term structure of redenomination risk|This paper assesses redenomination risk in the euro area. We first estimate daily default-risk-free yield curves for French, German, and Italian bonds that can be redenominated and for bonds that cannot. Then, we extract the compensation for redenomination risk from the yield spreads between these two types of bonds. Redenomination risk primarily shows up at the short end of yield curves. At the height of the euro crisis, spreads between first-year yields were close to 7% for Italy and up to -2% for Germany. The ECB's interventions designed to reduce breakup risk successfully did so for Italy, but increased it for France and Germany.
F31|Exchange Rate Pass-Through to Consumer Prices and the Role of Energy Prices|A group of researchers has asserted that the rate of exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to domestic prices has declined substantially over the last few decades. We revisit this claim of a downward trend in the rate of ERPT to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) by employing the vector autoregressive (VAR) model for the U.S. macroeconomic data under the current floating exchange rate regime. Our VAR approach that nests the conventional single equation method reveals very weak evidence of ERPT during the pre-1990 era. On the other hand, we observe statistically significant evidence of ERPT during the post-1990 era, which sharply contrasts with previous findings. After statistically confirming a structural break in ERPT to the total CPI via Hansen's (2001) test procedure, we seek the source of the structural break using the disaggregate level CPIs, which pinned down a key role of energy prices in explaining the emergence of the break. The dependency of the U.S. energy consumption on imports has increased since the 1990s. This change magnifies the effects of the exchange rate shock on domestic energy prices, resulting in greater responses of the total CPI via this energy price channel.
F31|Exchange Rate Policy and External Vulnerabilities in Sub-Saharan Africa: Nominal, Real or Mixed Targeting?|This paper discusses the theoretical choice of exchange rate anchors in Sub-Saharan African countries that are facing external vulnerabilities. To reduce instability, policymakers choose among promoting external competitiveness using a real anchor, lowering the burden of external debt using a nominal anchor or using a policy mix of both anchors. We observe that these countries tend to adopt mixed anchor policies. We solve a state space model to explain the determinants of and the strategy behind this policy. We find that the choice of policy mix is a two-step strategy: First, authorities choose the degree of nominal exchange rate flexibility according to the velocity of money, trade openness, foreign debt, degree of exchange rate pass-through and exchange rate target zone. Second, authorities seek to stabilize the real exchange rate depending on the degree of trade integration with the rest of world and the degree of foreign exchange interventions. We conclude with regime-switching estimations to provide empirical evidence of how these economic fundamentals influence exchange rate policy in Sub-Saharan Africa.
F31|GCC Sovereign Wealth Funds: Why do they Take Control?|In this paper we examine the investment strategy of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. GCC SWFs are considered as relatively opaque investors and strongly politicized, raising some concerns for perceived political and security risks. We investigate what are the drivers of majority cross- border equity acquisitions made by these institutional investors over the period 2006-2015. Using both Logit and ordered Logit models, we test if the usual determinants of SWFs investments still stand when we look at influential (> 10%) or majority (> 50%) acquisitions made by GCC SWFs. We find that GCC SWFs do not consider financial characteristics of the targeted firms when they acquire large cross-border stakes but rather the characteristics of the country (countries in the European union and/or countries with a high level of shareholders protection), suggesting that their motives may go beyond pure profit maximization. We also find that transparent funds are more likely to take influential or majority stakes and that they do so predominantly in non-strategic sectors. Overall, our results indicate that even if GCC SWFs do not seek only for financial returns, acquiring majority stakes is not a lever for GCC governments to get strategic interests in the target countries.
F31|Trade Policy and Market Power: Firm-level Evidence|This paper identifies the effect of trade policy on market power through new data and a new identication strategy. We use a large dataset containing export values and quantities by product and destination for all exporting firms in 12 developing and emerging countries over several years, merged with destination-product specific information on tariffs and non-tariff barriers. We identify market power by observing how exporting firms price discriminate across markets in reaction to variations in bilateral exchange rates. Pricing-to-market is prevalent in all regions of our sample, even among small firms, although it is increasing in firm size, in accordance with theory. More importantly, we find that the effect of non-tariff measures is not isomorphic to that of tariffs: the pricing-to-market behavior we observe suggests that, while tariffs reduce the market power of foreign firms through classic rent-shifting effects, non-tariff measures alter market structure and reinforce the market power of non-exiting firms, domestic and foreign ones alike. Keywords: Trade policy, non-tariff measures, tariffs, exchange rate, price discrimination
F31|Time-dependent lead-lag relationship between the onshore and offshore Renminbi exchange rates|We employ the thermal optimal path method to explore both the long-term and short-term interaction patterns between the onshore CNY and offshore CNH exchange rates (2012–2015). For the daily data, the CNY and CNH exchange rates show a weak alternate lead-lag structure in most of the time periods. When CNY and CNH display a large disparity, the lead-lag relationship is uncertain and depends on the prevailing market factors. The minute-scale interaction pattern between the CNY and CNH exchange rates change over time according to different market situations. We find that US dollar appreciation is associated with a lead-lag relationship running from offshore to onshore, while a (contrarian) Renminbi appreciation is associated with a lead-lag relationship running from onshore to offshore. These results are robust with respect to different sub-sample analyses and variations of the key smoothing parameter of the TOP method.
F31|The Determinants of Home Bias in Stock Portfolio: An Emerging and Developed Markets Study|The objective of this paper is to measure the degree of Home Bias within holdings portfolio and to identify their determining factors. By following literature and an international CAPM, we have chosen quite a number of susceptible factors that impact Home Bias. This model is, hence, estimated for 20 countries, with cross-section econometrics, between 2008 and 2013. Our results show that all countries have recorded a high level of Home bias in their holdings portfolio. After that, we test if the Home Bias of the emerging markets and that of the developed markets react differently to the determining factors. The volatility of the exchange rate is statistically significant with emerging markets, while it is hardly remarkable for the developed countries. Co-variance, size, distance, language, legal framework and foreign organization stocks prevents American investors to invest abroad.
F31|Model instability in predictive exchange rate regressions|In this paper we aim to improve existing empirical exchange rate models by accounting for uncertainty with respect to the underlying structural representation. Within a flexible Bayesian non-linear time series framework, our modeling approach assumes that different regimes are characterized by commonly used structural exchange rate models, with their evolution being driven by a Markov process. We assume a time-varying transition probability matrix with transition probabilities depending on a measure of the monetary policy stance of the central bank at the home and foreign country. We apply this model to a set of eight exchange rates against the US dollar. In a forecasting exercise, we show that model evidence varies over time and a model approach that takes this empirical evidence seriously yields improvements in accuracy of density forecasts for most currency pairs considered.
F31|Uncovered Return Parity: Equity Returns and Currency Returns|We propose an uncovered expected returns parity (URP) condition for the bilateral spot exchange rate. URP implies that unilateral exchange rate equations are misspecified and that equity returns also affect exchange rates. Fama regressions provide evidence that URP is statistically preferred to uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) for nominal bilateral exchange rates between the US dollar and six countries (Australia, Canada, Japan, Norway, Switzerland and the UK) at the monthly frequency. An implication of URP is that commodity price changes that affect equity returns thus affect bilateral exchange rates through the equity channel. We find evidence that the Australian, Canadian, Norwegian (post 2001) and UK (post 1992) expected exchange rates increase via the oil-equity channel as oil prices rise, whereas the Japanese and Swiss expected exchange rates decrease.
F31|The Share of Systematic Variations in the Canadian Dollar—Part I|In this analytical note we show that the share of the systematic variations in the Canadian dollar has risen significantly in the past two decades. Systematic variations in the exchange rate are shared with other currencies. This parallels the equity market, where variations in the price of a given stock are shared with variations in the prices of other stocks. In the simplest case—the capital asset pricing model—the amount of systematic variations is given by the covariance of this stock with the equity market index. In the context of currencies, exchange rate variations that are systematic originate from common international economic or financial conditions affecting all exchange rates. These systematic variations contrast with domestic changes in economic or financial conditions specific to one country and affecting only that country’s exchange rate. Separating systematic variations is useful and essential to identify the effect of domestic economic news or policy decisions on the exchange rate.
F31|The Impact of Surprising Monetary Policy Announcements on Exchange Rate Volatility|We identify a few Bank of Canada press releases that had the largest immediate impact on the exchange rate market. We find that volatility increases after these releases, but the effect is short-lived and mostly dissipates after the first hour, on average. Beyond the first hour, the size of the effect is similar to what we observe for other economic releases, such as those for inflation or economic growth data.
F31|Overcoming the Original Sin: Gains from Local Currency External Debt|Emerging markets increasingly rely on external debt denominated in local currency. In order to understand if this is a better situation than using US dollar denominated debt, I present a small open economy model with two sectors, and endogenous determination of both default risk and real exchange rate. Using a calibrated version of the model that replicates default frequency and debt level of emerging economies, I compare the two possibilities of debt denomination: local or foreign currency. I find that welfare gains from issuing debt in local currency derive from less frequent defaults, higher sustainable debt levels, and less volatile consumption and real exchange rates. However, even an economy issuing debt in local currency still faces counter-cyclical interest rate spread and real depreciations around default episodes.
F31|Price and cost competitiveness misalignments of the euro area and of its main economies according to a quarterly BEER model, 1999-2017|This study first assesses recent misalignments of the real effective exchange rate (REER) of the euro area and of the Harmonized Competitiveness Indicators (HCIs) of its main economies, based on a quarterly Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate (BEER) model. Next, it draws a comparison with comparable estimates published by the IMF and by CEPII. The BEER model here employed was first put forward by Fidora, Giordano and Schmitz (2017; 2018) and enables the assessment of the departure of actual REERs and HCIs from values consistent with underlying economic fundamentals (i.e. “equilibrium” values). The quarterly model has now been extended to cover a longer time span (1999-2017) and refined by employing new data sources, in particular relative to producer price indices, one of five alternative price/cost indicators used to derive the REERs and HCIs. There is evidence of a modest overvaluation of the euro-area REER in 2017, partly linked to the nominal appreciation of its currency in the second half of the year.
F31|Rethinking prices and markets underlying price-competitiveness indicators|A comprehensive analysis of price and cost competitiveness warrants an assessment of a range of alternately deflated nominal effective exchange rates. Here, we focus solely on the price-competitiveness indicator currently published by the Bank of Italy (Felettigh et al., 2015), which is based on the producer prices of domestically-sold manufactures, and we refine its measurement. First, we update the data sources for the producer price index. Revisions mainly refer to non-euro area countries, yet also affect relative prices and therefore the price-competitiveness trends of the four main euro-area economies. These countries have performed better according to the revised indicators, in particular since 2010. Second, we present a novel three-market view of price-competitiveness indicators by splitting destination markets. The overall indicator encompassing competitive pressures on both the import and the export side can indeed be broken down into three components: the domestic market, where local producers are rivalled by foreign competitors with their import penetration; euro-area markets, where all countries compete; and non-euro-area markets, where, similarly, all countries compete. Whereas France and Germany have displayed similar price-competitiveness developments in both the euro and non-euro area markets over the entire period since 1999, Italy and Spain have performed better in the non-euro area than in the euro-area markets. Competitiveness in the domestic market and that in non-euro area markets are the main, equally important, drivers of overall developments since 1999 in Italy and in Germany.
F31|ECB monetary policy and the euro exchange rate|The paper provides empirical evidence on the effects of ECB conventional and unconventional monetary policy on the euro exchange rate, focusing on the period from January 2013 to September 2017. Innovations to conventional and unconventional monetary policies are identified through changes in, respectively, short- and long-term interest rates immediately after Governing Council meetings. Both types of measures contributed to the depreciation of the euro from mid-2014; surprises associated with conventional measures had a stronger and more persistent effect than those associated with unconventional ones. Time-varying estimates of the effects of conventional surprises since 1999 show that the responsiveness of exchange rates to monetary news increased markedly from 2013. State-dependence analysis finds that the exchange rate became more sensitive to monetary policy when the ECB adopted a policy of negative interest rates and when conventional and unconventional monetary surprises moved in the same direction.
