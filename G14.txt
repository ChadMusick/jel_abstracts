G14|Does the Cost of Private Debt Respond to Monetary Policy? Heteroskedasticity-Based Identification in a Model with Regimes|We investigate the effects of a conventional monetary expansion, the quantitative easing, and maturity extension programs on the yields of corporate bonds. We adopt a multiple-regime VAR identification based on heteroskedasticity. An impulse response function analysis shows that a traditional, rate based expansionary policy leads to an increase in yields. The response to quantitative easing is instead a general and persistent decrease, in particular for long-term bonds. The responses generated by the maturity extension program are significant and of larger magnitude. A decomposition shows that the unconventional programs reduce the cost private debt primarily through a reduction in risk premia.
G14|Bond Funds and Fixed-Income Market Liquidity: A Stress-Testing Approach|This report provides a detailed technical description of a stress test model for investment funds called Ceto. The model quantifies how asset sales from investment funds could amplify a sudden decline in asset prices through the liquidity risk premium of the corporate bond market. Ceto is grounded in the literature on agents’ incentives and behaviour: it considers the response of investors to fund performance and the liquidity-management decisions of portfolio managers to meet demands for redemptions. The model also explicitly accounts for the provision of liquidity by broker-dealers and other potential buy-side investors. By accounting for the behaviour of different types of market participants, our approach allows us to account for the rich institutional features of, and heterogeneity within, the Canadian corporate bond market. The model can accommodate a range of different risk scenarios.
G14|The BoC-BoE Sovereign Default Database: What’s New in 2019?|Until recently, few efforts have been made to systematically measure and aggregate the nominal value of the different types of sovereign government debt in default. To help fill this gap, the Bank of Canada (BoC) developed a comprehensive database of sovereign defaults that is posted on its website and updated in partnership with the Bank of England (BoE). Our database draws on previously published datasets compiled by various public and private sector sources. It combines elements of these, together with new information, to develop comprehensive estimates of stocks of government obligations in default. These include bonds and other marketable securities, bank loans and official loans, valued in US dollars, for the years 1960 to 2018 on both a country-by-country and a global basis. This update of the BoC-BoE database, and future updates, will be useful to researchers analyzing the economic and financial effects of individual sovereign defaults and, importantly, the impact on global financial stability of episodes involving multiple sovereign defaults.
G14|Using Exchange-Traded Funds to Measure Liquidity in the Canadian Corporate Bond Market|We introduce a new proxy for measuring corporate bond liquidity, using the price of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold corporate bonds. It measures the average liquidity across 900 corporate bonds every day, many more than other proxies used in previous Bank of Canada analysis. The new proxy nonetheless paints a very similar picture of liquidity conditions and confirms the previous findings: the liquidity of bonds has generally improved since 2010.
G14|What does not kill us makes us stronger: the story of repetitive consumer loan applications|We investigate borrower and lender behaviours when the borrower has experienced a sequence of failed loan applications. Our analysis is based on half a million observations from an established peer-to-peer (P2P) loan platform in China over 2010-2018. We find that borrowers with better credit scores and those who can offer higher rates are likely to reapply for funds after a failed attempt. Yet, females and applicants with better education are discouraged quickly. On the funding supply side, lenders strive to fund safe borrowers with high credit rating and high income, not those who offer high interest rate.

G14|Informed trading in a two-tier market structure under financial distress|The sovereign bond market has traditionally been the dominant segment of the euro area bond market and it is one of the largest in the world. Secondary market liquidity is an essential feature of a well-functioning and resilient government bond market. The secondary market of the European sovereign bonds is organised as a two-tier electronic market, with an inter-dealer and a dealer-to-customer segment. The previous literature uses a sequential trade model, to investigate the probability of informed trading (PIN) in the parallel trading of the same bond on these two venues, finding that the PIN is significantly lower in the dealer-to-customer segment than in the inter-dealer one. We contribute to the existing literature analysing this two-tier market for a longer period, which includes episodes of financial distress in the Eurozone and various ECB interventions to try to contain the crisis. We show that the crisis deeply affected the two segments of the market, reverting the conclusion about the presence of informed traders in the two platforms for some periods, and questioning the need for this trading structure and its stability.
G14|Have FSRs got news for you? Evidence from the impact of Financial Stability Reports on market activity|We investigate the impact that the publication of the Bank of England’s Financial Stability Report (FSR) has on the stock returns and credit default swap spreads of UK financial institutions. Examining a sample of 73 UK-listed banks and other financial institutions, we find that publication of the FSR is, on average, associated with no abnormal returns. We extend our analysis to examine the extent to which policies and the sentiment in the FSR are predictable, which would explain the observed lack of abnormal returns. We find that both sentiment and announced policies are predictable. We also examine the extent to which the release of the FSR reduces information asymmetry in financial markets, but do not find strong evidence.
G14|The cost of clearing fragmentation|Fragmenting clearing across multiple central counter-parties (CCPs) is costly. This is because dealers providing liquidity globally, cannot net trades cleared in different CCPs and this increases their collateral costs. These costs are then passed on to their clients through price distortions which take the form of a price differential (basis) when the same products are cleared in different CCPs. Using proprietary data, we document an economically significant CCP basis for dollar swap contracts cleared both at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the London Clearing House (LCH) and provide empirical evidence consistent with a collateral cost explanation of this basis.

G14|A simple return generating model in discrete time; implications for market efficiency testing|A linear return generating model is introduced. This model is a generalization in discrete time of the differential equation describing dynamical systems in continuous time. The model is useful in its own right, as it provides a simplified, yet credible, quantitative description of the reality. Further, the model is used as a tool for a theoretical study of market efficiency testing. This is obtained by modelling certain market conditions under which new information is released and reflected in asset prices on the one hand, and, on the other hand, by recording what established econometric testing approaches conclude, about the hypothesis of market efficiency. Amongst others it is argued that, contrary to the general belief, theoretically a random walk in asset prices, under certain conditions, could be associated with profoundly inefficient markets. Furthermore, an enhancement of the battery of statistical tests for market efficiency is proposed by the potential application of specific forms of the suggested linear dynamic model and the possible advantages over the existing techniques are discussed.
G14|The Impacts of Macroeconomic News Announcements on Intraday Implied Volatility|This study examines the response of intraday options-implied volatilities to scheduled announcements of major macroeconomic indicators. By analyzing the KOSPI 200 options intraday data, we find that the abnormal implied volatility significantly increases around announcements of macroeconomic news and that the extent of the response is influenced by a variety of factors, including the type of macroeconomic indicators released, option type and economic conditions. Specifically, the increase in implied volatility around these announcements is more pronounced for puts than for calls. These effects are also more pronounced in the crisis and post-crisis periods than in the pre-crisis period. Monetary policy announcements have a more substantial impact on implied volatility than other announcements, even after controlling for news surprise components. Finally, the impact appears to be greater for policy rate hikes than for policy rate cuts.
G14|Fast trading and the virtue of entropy: evidence from the foreign exchange market|Focusing on the foreign exchange reaction to macroeconomic announcements, we show that fast trading is positively and significantly correlated with the entropy of the distribution of quoted prices in reaction to news: a larger share of fast trading increases the degree of diversity of quotes in the order book, for given liquidity, order book depth and size of order flows. Exploiting the WM Reuters’ reform of the fixing methodology in February 2015 as a natural experiment, we provide evidence that fast trading raises entropy, rather than reacting to it. While more entropy in quoted prices means noisier information and arguably complicates price discovery from an individual trader’s perspective, we show that, in the aggregate, more entropy actually brings traded prices closer to the random walk hypothesis, and improves indicators of market efficiency and quality of trade execution. We estimate that a 10 percent increase in entropy reduces the negative impact of macro news by over 60% for effective spreads, against over 40% for realized spreads and price impacts. Our findings suggest that the main mechanism by which fast trading may have desirable effects on market performance specifically hinges on enhanced heterogeneity in trading patterns, best captured by entropy.

G14|On the Effects of the ECB’s Funding Policies on Bank Lending and the Demand for the Euro as an International Reserve|The euro-area financial crisis that erupted in 2009 was marked by negative confidence effects that had both domestic and international ramifications. Domestically, bank lending declined sharply. Internationally, the demand for the euro as a reserve currency fell precipitously. We investigate the effects of ECB policies on banks’ lending, taking account of national and regional spillovers. We also assess the effects of ECB policies on euro reserve holdings. The results suggest that those policies were important for rebuilding confidence, thus supporting both bank lending and the use of the euro as a reserve asset.
G14|Herding behaviour in an emerging market: Evidence from the Moscow Exchange|This study investigates the extent to which herding towards the market consensus for Russian stocks is driven by fundamental and non-fundamental factors. We find evidence that investors on the Moscow Exchange herd without any reference to fundamentals during unanticipated financial crises coupled with high uncertainty, in falling markets, and during days with extreme upward oil price movements. The results indicate that companies with less transparent information environment, proxied by company size and the number of analysts following the company, are more prone to herding driven by non-fundamental factors. This herding behaviour temporarily impedes the incorporation of all relevant fundamental information into stock prices and diverts the market from its efficient state. In contrast, in periods of high liquidity and on days of international sanction announcements during the Ukrainian crisis herding behaviour is merely driven by fundamentals. In Russia, macroeconomic news releases induce both information-related herding and herding without any reference to fundamentals. These results suggest that motives of investors herding behaviour vary under specific market conditions and share characteristics.
G14|Aggregation of Diverse Information with Double Auction Trading among Minimally-Intelligent Algorithmic Agents|Information dissemination and aggregation are key economic functions of financial markets. How intelligent do traders have to be for the complex task of aggregating diverse information (i.e., approximate the predictions of the rational expectations equilibrium) in a competitive double auction market? An apparent ex-ante answer is: intelligent enough to perform the bootstrap operation necessary for the task—to somehow arrive at prices that are needed to generate those very prices. Constructing a path to such equilibrium through rational behavior has remained beyond what we know of human cognitive abilities. Yet, laboratory experiments report that profit motivated human traders are able to aggregate information in some, but not all, market environments (Plott and Sunder 1988, Forsythe and Lundholm 1990). Algorithmic agents have the potential to yield insights into how simple individual behavior may perform this complex market function as an emergent phenomenon. We report on a computational experiment with markets populated by algorithmic traders who follow cognitively simple heuristics humans are known to use. These markets, too, converge to rational expectations equilibria in environments in which human markets converge, albeit slowly and noisily. The results suggest that high level of individual intelligence or rationality is not necessary for efficient outcomes to emerge at the market level; the structure of the market itself is a source of rationality observed in the outcomes.
G14|The War in Europe: Economic Costs of the Ukrainian Conflict|With more than ten thousand casualties, the 2014 Ukrainian war between pro-Russian separatists and the government in the Donbass region, Ukraine's productive core, has taken a severe toll on the country. Using cross-country panel data over the period 1995-2017, this paper quantifies the short-term causal effects of the Donbass war on Ukraine's GDP. Results from the counterfactual estimation by the synthetic control method show that Ukraine's per capita GDP foregone due to the war amounts to 15.1% on average for 2013-2017. Separate analysis for the affected provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk indicate an average causal effect of 43% for 2013-2016. Confoundedness checks obtained by iteratively estimating synthetic controls on the pre-war period to account for previous Ukrainian-Russian disputes show robustness of the results.
G14|What Option Prices tell us about the ECB's Unconventional Monetary Policies|We use a series of different approaches to extract information about crash risk from option prices for the Euro-Dollar exchange rate, with each step sharpening the focus on extracting more specific measures of crash risk around dates of ECB measures of Unconventional Monetary Policy. Several messages emerge from the analysis. Announcing policies in general terms without precisely describing what exactly they entail does not move asset markets or actually increases crash risk. Also, policies directly focused on changing relative asset supplies do seem to have an impact, while measures aiming at easing financing costs of commercial banks do not.
G14|Security design and credit rating risk in the CLO market|In this paper, we empirically explore the effect of the complexity of a security's design on hypotheses relating to credit rating shopping and rating catering in the collateralized loan obligation (CLO) market in the period before and after the global financial crisis in 2007. We find that complexity of a CLO's design is an important factor in explaining the likelihood that market participants display behaviors consistent with either rating shopping or rating catering. In the period prior to 2007, we observe for more complex CLOs a higher incidence of dual-rated tranches, which are more likely to have been catered by credit rating agencies to match each other. Conversely, in the period after 2007, for CLOs, it is more likely that issuers shopped for ratings, in particular opting for a single credit rating by Moody's, not by S&P. Furthermore, contrary to what market participants might expect, investors do not value dual ratings more than single ratings in the determination of the offering yield at issuance. Looking at the explanatory power of credit ratings for a dual rated CLO, the degree to which investors increase their reliance on credit ratings depends to a large extent on the disclosure of an S&P rating, not Moody's. This suggests that investors recognize credit rating risk by agency in pricing CLOs. In sum, the policy implication is that, to effectively regulate CLOs, the regulatory environment ought to differentiate between complex and non-complex CLOs.
G14|Measuring Euro Area Monetary Policy|We map ECB policy communication into yield curve changes and study the information flow on policy dates. A byproduct is the publicly available Euro Area Monetary Policy Event- Study Database (EA-MPD), containing intraday asset price changes. We find that Policy Target, Forward Guidance and Quantitative Easing factors capture about all the variation in the yield curve, with different factors appearing in the windows covering the policy decision announcement and the press conference, and having time-varying variance shares. We study sovereign yields, exchange rates, stock prices, persistence of effects and response asymmetry. Our methodology can be implemented for any policy-related event.
G14|Competition among high-frequency traders, and market quality|We study empirically how competition among high-frequency traders (HFTs) affects their trading behavior and market quality. Our analysis exploits a unique dataset, which allows us to compare environments with and without high-frequency competition, and contains an exogenous event - a tick size reform - which we use to disentangle the effects of the rising share of high-frequency trading in the market from the effects of high-frequency competition. We find that when HFTs compete, their speculative trading increases. As a result, market liquidity deteriorates and short-term volatility rises. Our findings hold for a variety of market quality and high-frequency trading behavior measures. JEL Classification: G12, G14, G15, G18, G23, D4, D61

G14|Monetary policy shocks and the health of banks|Based on high frequency identification and other econometric tools, we find that monetary policy shocks had a significant impact on the health of euro area banks. Information effects, which made the private sector more pessimistic about future prospects of the economy and the profitability of the banking sector, were strongly present in the post-crisis period. We show that ECB communications at the press conference were crucial for the market response and that bank health benefitted from surprises, which steepened the yield curve. We find that the effects of monetary policy shocks on banks displayed some persistence. Other bank characteristics, in particular bank size, leverage and NPL ratios, amplified the impact of monetary policy shocks on banks. After the OMT announcement, we detect that the response of bank stocks to monetary policy shocks normalised. We discover that, in the post-crisis episode, Fed monetary policy shocks influenced euro area bank stock valuations. JEL Classification: E40, E52, G14, G21
G14|Has the new bail-in framework increased the yield spread between subordinated and senior bonds?|This paper investigates the impact of the introduction and implementation of the new EU bail-in framework on the banks subordinated bond yield spreads over senior unsecured bonds, and links the bond yields developments with the characteristics of the issuing entities and the economic and financial environment. The analysis does not show evidence of a significant and generalized increase in the spreads as a result of a higher risk perception in the sample under review. The results reinforce the relevance of the Tier 1 capital ratio for making subordinated debt safer, while markets price the higher risk of banks with less stable sources of funding in their liability/capital structures. Market conditions and economic environment variables also play a key role in explaining bond spreads. Interestingly, after the introduction of the new bail-in framework, there is a convergence between the bond yields of the GSIBs and the non-GSIBs, which could point out to a reduction in the market perception of the so called “too big to fail” public implicit guarantee. Nonetheless, this convergence is mostly driven by the reduction of the yields of bonds issued by banks not categorized as GSIBs, and not by significant increases in the GSIBs’ bond yields. JEL Classification: G12, G14, G28
G14|Are Analyst Trade Ideas Valuable?|Using a novel database, we show that the stock-price impact of analyst trade ideas is at least as large as the impact of stock recommendation, target price, and earnings forecast changes, and that investors following trade ideas can earn significant abnormal returns. Trade ideas triggered by forthcoming firm catalyst events are more informative than ideas exploiting temporary mispricing. Institutional investors trade in the direction of trade ideas and commission-paying institutional clients do so earlier than non-clients. Analysts generating trade ideas are more established and are more likely to produce ideas for stocks with high dollar trading commissions in their coverage universe.
G14|Security Analysis: An Investment Perspective|The investment theory, in which the expected return varies cross-sectionally with investment, expected profitability, and expected growth, is a good start to understanding Graham and Doddâ€™s (1934) Security Analysis. Empirically, the q5 model goes a long way toward explaining prominent equity strategies rooted in security analysis, including Frankel and Leeâ€™s (1998) intrinsic-to-market value, Piotroskiâ€™s (2000) fundamental score, Greenblattâ€™s (2005) â€œmagic formula,â€ Asness, Frazzini, and Pedersenâ€™s (2019) quality-minus-junk, Buffettâ€™s Berkshire, Bartram and Grinblattâ€™s (2018) agnostic analysis, as well as Penman and Zhuâ€™s (2014, 2018) and Lewellenâ€™s (2015) expected-return strategies.
G14|Where's the Greenium?|This study investigates whether investors are willing to trade-off wealth for societal benefits. We take advantage of unique institutional features of the municipal securities market to provide insight into this question. Since 2013, over $23 billion Green Bonds have been issued to fund eco-friendly projects. Comparing Green securities to nearly identical securities issued for non-Green purposes by the same issuers on the same day, we observe economically identical pricing for Green and non-Green issues. In contrast to a number of recent theoretical and experimental studies, we find that in real market settings investors appear entirely unwilling to forgo wealth to invest in environmentally sustainable projects. When risk and payoffs are held constant, municipal investors view Green and non-Green securities by the same issuer as almost exact substitutes. Thus, the â€œgreeniumâ€ is essentially zero.
G14|Asset Liquidity in Monetary Theory and Finance: A Unified Approach|Economists often say that certain types of assets, e.g., Treasury bonds, are very `liquid'. Do they mean that these assets are likely to serve as media of exchange or collateral (a definition of liquidity often employed in monetary theory), or that they can be easily sold in a secondary market, if needed (a definition of liquidity closer to the one adopted in finance)? We develop a model where these two notions of asset liquidity coexist, and their relative importance is determined endogenously in general equilibrium: how likely agents are to visit a secondary market in order to sell assets for money depends on whether sellers of goods/services accept these assets as means of payment. But, also, the incentive of sellers to invest in a technology that allows them to recognize and accept assets as means of payment depends on the existence (and efficiency) of a secondary market where buyers could liquidate assets for cash. The interaction between these two channels offers new insights regarding the determination of asset prices and the ability of assets to facilitate transactions and improve welfare.
G14|Style consistency and mutual fund returns: the case of Russia|This paper carries out style analysis for Russian mutual funds using monthly data from the National Managers’ Association over the period January 2008-December 2017; specifically, it applies the RSBA method developed by Sharpe (1992) for evaluating the impact of style on returns, and uses the Style Drift Score (SDS) introduced by Idzorek (2004) as a measure of a fund’s style drifting activity. The main findings can be summarised as follows. In the Russian case there is a significant positive relationship between style consistency and profitability of funds. Further, Russian funds are characterised by a high level of style drift, namely deviations from the investment strategy declared at the time of registration as required by Russian law.
G14|Measuring euro area monetary policy|We study the information flow from the ECB on policy dates since its inception, using tick data. We show that three factors capture about all of the variation in the yield curve but that these are different factors with different variance shares in the window that contains the policy decision announcement and the window that contains the press conference. We also show that the QE-related policy factor has been dominant in the recent period and that Forward Guidance and QE effects have been very persistent on the longer-end of the yield curve. We further show that broad and banking stock indices’ responses to monetary policy surprises depended on the perceived nature of the surprises. We find no evidence of asymmetric responses of financial markets to positive and negative surprises, in contrast to the literature on asymmetric real effects of monetary policy. Lastly, we show how to implement our methodology for any policy-related news release, such as policymaker speeches. To carry out the analysis, we construct the Euro Area Monetary Policy Event-Study Database (EA-MPD). This database, which contains intraday asset price changes around the policy decision announcement as well as around the press conference, is a contribution on its own right and we expect it to be the standard in monetary policy research for the euro area.

G14|The Intangibles Song in Takeover Announcements: Good Tempo, Hollow Tune|Mergers and acquisitions are often motivated by the intention of creating value from intangible assets. We develop a novel word list of intangibles and apply it to takeover announcements. Deals presented with more “intangibles talk” complete more quickly. However, the value of these deals to the acquirer is questionable: One standard deviation more in intangibles talk results in 0.45 percentage points lower abnormal announcement returns of bidders. Agency problems explain little of these results. Instead, payment mode choices and insider trades suggest that intangibles talk reflects managerial overoptimism. Overall, takeover announcements can provide important information regarding the quality of deals.
G14|Lured by the Consensus|We find that investors are fixated on analysts’ consensus outputs (earnings forecasts, recommendations, and forecast dispersion), which can be inferior signals compared to the corresponding outputs provided by high-quality analysts, especially when a large number of high-quality analysts follow the firm. This result, which holds at the firm and market level, implies inefficient use of the information contained in analysts’ outputs. Further, the post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) phenomenon occurs only when high-quality analysts are more uncertain about the firm’s performance than all analysts following the firm. We conclude that the market’s fixation on consensus measures has significant negative economic implications.
G14|Do Index Funds Monitor?|We examine whether the rise of index investing leads to increased agency conflicts. Using a new research design that generates exogenous variation in fund holdings, we find that index funds are weak monitors. Unlike active funds, index funds rarely vote against firm management on corporate governance issues. Moreover, although index funds do exit 16% of their holdings each year, they do not use exit to enforce good governance. They also rarely file a Schedule 13D, indicating they do not intend to affect firm policies. Our results show the rise of index investing is shifting control from investors to corporate managers.
G14|Sticking around Too Long? Dynamics of the Benefits of Dual-Class Voting|Using a new dataset of corporate voting-rights from 1971 to 2015, we find that young dual-class firms trade at a premium and operate at least as efficiently as young single-class firms. As dual-class firms mature, their valuation declines, and they become less efficient in their margins, innovation, and labor productivity compared to their single-class counterparts. Voting premiums increase with firm age, suggesting that private benefits increase over maturity. Most sunset provisions that dual-class firms adopt are ineffective. Our findings suggest that effective, time-consistent sunset provisions would be based on age or on inferior shareholders’ periodic right to eliminate dual-class voting.
G14|FinTechs and the Market for Financial Analysis|Market intelligence FinTechs aggregate many data sources, including nontraditional ones, and synthesize such data using artificial intelligence to make investment recommendations. Using data from a market intelligence FinTech, we evaluate the relationship between the FinTech data coverage and market efficiency. We find an increase in price informativeness for stocks with higher FinTech coverage and that traditional sources of information have less impact on prices for those stocks. Consistent with FinTechs changing investors' behavior, we show a substitution between traditional information sources and FinTechs using internet click data. Overall, our results suggest the rise in FinTechs for investment recommendations benefits investors.
G14|What Do Insiders Know? Evidence from Insider Trading Around Share Repurchases and SEOs|We examine the nature of information contained in insider trades prior to corporate events. Insiders’ net buying increases before open market share repurchase announcements and decreases before SEOs. Higher insider net buying is associated with better post-event operating performance, a reduction in undervaluation, and, for repurchases, lower post-event cost of capital. Insider trading predicts announcement returns and, for repurchases, the long-term drift following events. Overall, our results suggest that insider trades before corporate events contain information about changes both in fundamentals and in investor sentiment. Information about fundamentals is incorporated slowly into prices, while information about mispricing is incorporated faster.
G14|ICO Investors|We conduct a detailed analysis of investors in successful initial coin offerings (ICOs). The average ICO has 4,700 contributors. The median participant contributes small amounts and many investors sell their tokens before the underlying product is developed. Large presale investors obtain tokens at a discount and flip part of their allocation shortly after the ICO. ICO contributors lack the protections traditionally afforded to investors in early stage financing. Nevertheless, returns nine months after the ICO are positive on average, driven mostly by an increase in the value of the Ethereum cryptocurrency.
G14|Unintended Consequences of Unemployment Insurance Benefits: The Role of Banks|Unemployment insurance (UI) policies are implemented by many countries to lower individual income risk and to automatically stabilize macroeconomic fluctuations. To the extent that these policies are successful, however, they should be reducing precautionary savings and hence bank deposits – households' major saving instrument. In this paper, we use this lower incentive to save and uncover a novel distortionary mechanism through which UI policies affect the economy. In particular, we show that when state UI benefits become more generous bank deposits decrease. Since deposits are the main and uniquely stable funding source for banks, the decrease in deposits squeezes bank commercial lending, which in turn reduces firm investment.
G14|Análisis de sentimientos de noticias e inversionistas en el mercado bursátil|Este trabajo estudia en la relación estadística entre el sentimiento de inversionistas y de noticias con la dirección del movimiento del S&P 500 en ventanas de 30 minutos. Específicamente, se utilizan algoritmos de Machine Learning para estimar una medida representativa del sentimiento de los inversionistas y de noticias a partir de mensajes de usuarios de StockTwits, que luego se utilizaron de manera conjunta e individual para pronosticar la dirección del SP 500. Se encontró que con la inclusión del sentimiento de los inversionistas se alcanzó una exactitud del 58%, por encima del 50% obtenido por un modelo autorregresivo. No obstante, se determinó que la integración del análisis de sentimiento de noticias no aumentó la predictibilidad del índice en cuestión.
G14|Volatility, Valuation Ratios, and Bubbles: An Empirical Measure of Market Sentiment|We define a sentiment indicator that exploits two contrasting views of return predictability, and study its properties. The indicator, which is based on option prices, valuation ratios and interest rates, was unusually high during the late 1990s, reflecting dividend growth expectations that in our view were unreasonably optimistic. We interpret it as helping to reveal irrational beliefs about fundamentals. We show that our measure is a leading indicator of detrended volume, and of various other measures associated with financial fragility. We also make two methodological contributions. First, we derive a new valuation-ratio decomposition that is related to the Campbell and Shiller (1988) loglinearization, but which resembles the traditional Gordon growth model more closely and has certain other advantages for our purposes. Second, we introduce a volatility index that provides a lower bound on the market's expected log return.

G14|The Sound Of Many Funds Rebalancing|This paper proposes that computational complexity generates noise. In modern financial markets, it is common to find the same asset held for completely different reasons by funds following a wide variety of threshold-based trading rules. Under these conditions, we show that it can be computationally infeasible to predict how these various trading rules will interact with one another. Formally, we prove that it is NP hard to predict the sign of the net demand coming from a large interacting mass of funds at a rate better than chance. Thus, market participants will treat these demand shocks as random noise even if they are fully rational. This noise-generating mechanism can produce noise in a wide range of markets and also predicts how noise will vary across assets. We verify this prediction empirically using data on the exchange-traded fund (ETF) market.
G14|Do Fundamentals Drive Cryptocurrency Prices?|We test the theoretical prediction that blockchain trustworthiness and transaction benefits determine cryptocurrency prices. We measure these two fundamentals with blockchain computing power (i.e., hashrate) and network size, respectively, and find a significant long-run relationship between these blockchain characteristics and the prices of five prominent cryptocurrencies. We also document that the returns of the five cryptocurrencies are exposed to fundamental-based risk factors related to computing power and network size, even after controlling for Bitcoin returns and cryptocurrency momentum. In out-of-sample tests, the computing power and network factors can explain the return variation of a broad set of cryptocurrencies.
G14|Clients' Connections: Measuring the Role of Private Information in Decentralised Markets|We propose a new measure of private information in decentralised markets -- connections -- defined as the number of dealers with whom a client trades in a time period. Using proprietary data for the UK government bond market, we show that clients have systematically better performance when having more connections, and this effect is stronger during macroeconomic announcements. Time-variation in market-wide connections also helps explain yield dynamics. Given our novel measure, we present two applications suggesting that (i) dealers pass on information, acquired from their informed clients, to their subsidiaries, and (ii) informed clients better predict the order-flow intermediated by their dealers.
G14|Credit Building or Credit Crumbling? A Credit Builder Loan's Effects on Consumer Behavior, Credit Scores and Their Predictive Power|There is little evidence on how the large market for credit score improvement products affects consumers or credit market efficiency. A randomized encouragement design on a standard credit builder loan (CBL) identifies null average effects on whether consumers have a credit score and the score itself, with important heterogeneity: those with loans outstanding at baseline fare worse, those without fare better. Selection, treatment effect, and prediction models indicate the CBL reveals valuable information to markets, inducing positive selection and making credit histories more precise, while keeping credit scores' predictive power intact. With modest targeting changes, CBLs could work as intended.
G14|The Value of Intermediation in the Stock Market|Brokers continue to play a critical role in intermediating institutional stock market transactions. More than half of all institutional investor order flow is still executed by high-touch (non-electronic) brokers. Despite the continued importance of brokers, we have limited information on what drives investors' choices among them. We develop and estimate an empirical model of broker choice that allows us to quantitatively examine each investor's' responsiveness to execution costs and access to research and order flow information. Studying over 300 million institutional trades, we find that investor demand is relatively inelastic with respect to commissions and that investors are willing to pay a premium for access to top research analysts and order-flow information. There is substantial heterogeneity across investors. Relative to other investors, hedge funds tend to be more price insensitive, place less value on sell-side research, and place more value on order-flow information. Furthermore, using trader-level data, we find that investors are more likely to trade with traders who are located physically closer and are less likely to trade with traders that have misbehaved in the past. Lastly, we use our empirical model to investigate the unbundling of equity research and execution services related to the MiFID II regulations. While under-reporting for the average firm is relatively small (4%), we find that the bundling of execution and research allows some institutional investors to under-report management fees by up to 15%.
G14|Stock Market's Assessment of Monetary Policy Transmission: The Cash Flow Effect|We show that firm liability structure and associated cash flow matter for firm behavior, and that financial market participants price stocks accordingly. Looking at firm level stock price changes around monetary policy announcements, we find that firms that have more cash flow exposure see their stock prices affected more. The stock price reaction depends on the maturity and type of debt issued by the firm, and the forward guidance provided by the Fed. This effect has remained intact during the ZLB period. Importantly, we show that the effect is not a rule of thumb behavior outcome and that the marginal stock market participant actually studies and reacts to the liability structure of firm balance sheets. The cash flow exposure at the time of monetary policy actions predicts future net worth, investment, and assets, verifying the stock pricing decision and also providing evidence of cash flow effects on firms' real behavior. The results hold for S&P500 firms that are usually thought of not being subject to tight financial constraints.
G14|Price Discovery in Agricultural Commodity Markets: Do Speculators Contribute?|Previous literature on price discovery in commodity markets is mainly focused on the question whether the spot or the futures market dominates the price discovery process. Little attention, however, has been paid to the question how the price discovery process is affected by futures speculation. Using different measures for speculation and hedging and a new price discovery metric, the present study analyzes this relationship for various agricultural commodities. The results indicate that speculative activity generally reduces the level of noise in the futures market, while increasing the relative contribution of the futures market to the price discovery process.
G14|Private Information and Client Connections in Government Bond Markets|In government bond markets the number of dealers with whom clients trade changes through time. Our paper shows that this time-variation in clients’ connections serves as a proxy for time-variation in private information. Using proprietary data covering close to all dealer-client transactions in the UK government bond market, we show that clients have systematically better performance when trading with more dealers, and this effect is stronger during macroeconomic announcements. Most of the effect comes from clients’ increased ability to predict future yield changes (anticipation component) rather than these clients facing tighter bid-ask spreads (transaction component). To explore the nature of this private information, we find that clients with increased dealer connections can better predict the fraction of the aggregate order flow that is intermediated by dealers they regularly trade with. Positive trading performance is concentrated in those periods when clients have more dealer connections than usual.
G14|Group affiliation and default prediction|Using a large sample of business groups from more than one hundred countries around the world, we show that group information matters for parent and subsidiary default prediction. Group firms may support each other when in financial distress. Potential group support represents an off-balance sheet asset for the receiving firm and an off-balance sheet liability for the firm offering support. We find that subsidiary information improves parent default prediction over and above group-level consolidated information possibly because intra-group exposures are netted out upon consolidation. Moreover, we document that the improvements in parent default prediction are decreasing in the extent of parent-country financial reporting transparency which suggests that within-group information matters most when consolidated financial statements are expected to be of lower quality. We also show that parent and other group-firms’ default risk exhibits predictive power for subsidiary default. Lastly, we find that within-group information explains cross-sectional variation in CDS spreads. Taken together, our findings contribute to prior literature on default prediction and have direct relevance to investors, credit-rating agencies and accounting regulators.
G14|Central Bank Intervention, Bubbles and Risk in Walrasian Financial Markets|The paper investigates the effects of central bank interventions in financial markets, composed of asymmetrically-informed rational investors and noise traders. If the central bank suspects a bubble, it should lift the real risk-free rate to deflate the bubble in “leaning against the wind”. A rise in the real risk-free rate reduces the risk of rational informed investors, and increases the risk of rational uninformed investors. If the central bank intervenes through the nominal risk-free rate and the Fisher arbitrage condition holds, an increase in the nominal rate is transferred to inflation, thereby dampening the policy effect. Conversely, this implies that the central bank can also deflate the bubble by inducing a reduction in inflationary expectations. The effect on the informed investor risk remains ambiguous, while the risk of he uninformed investor grows, but only if they suffer from money illusion.
G14|Fed’s Unconventional Monetary Policy and Risk Spillover in the US Financial Markets|This study examines volatility spillover dynamics among the S&P 500 index, the US 10-year Treasury yield, the US dollar index futures and the commodity price index. The focus of the study is to analyze effects of Fed’s unconventional monetary policy on the US financial markets. We use realized volatility measures based on daily data covering the period from December 29, 1996 to November 12, 2018. To address nonlinear and asymmetric spillover dynamics in low and high volatility states, we propose a new regime-dependent spillover index based on a smooth transition vector autoregressive (STVAR) model, extending the study of Diebold and Yilmaz (2009,2012) to regime switching models. When applied to US financial data, we find strong evidence that the US financial market risk structure changes after the announcement of quantitively easing (QE) through the portfolio balance channel. The risk spillover moves from purchased assets to non-purchased assets after the QE announcements.
G14|Causality in Quantiles and Dynamic Relations in Energy Markets| In this paper we investigate the dynamic relations between crude oil price returns and a set of energy price returns, namely diesel, gasoline, heating, and the natural gas. This is performed by means of Granger non-causality tests for US spot closing prices over the period from January 1997 to December 2017. In previous studies this has been done by testing for the added predictive value of including lagged values of one energy price return in predicting the conditional expectation of another. In this paper, we instead focus on different ranges of the full conditional distribution within the framework of a dynamic quantile regression model, and identify the quantile ranges from which causality arises. The results constitute a richer set of findings than what is possible by just considering a single moment of the conditional distribution, which can be useful for implementing better substitution investment strategies and effective policy interventions. We find several interesting one-directional dynamic relations between the employed energy prices, especially in the tail quantiles, but also a bi-directional causal relation between energy prices for which the classical Granger non-causality test suggests otherwise. Our results are robust to alternative measures of the price of oil and different data frequencies.
G14|Information in Yield Spread Trades|Using positions data on bond futures, I document that speculators' spread trades contain private information about future economic activities and asset prices. Strong steepening trades are associated with negative payroll surprises in subsequent months and can predict asset markets' reaction to future payroll releases, suggesting that speculators hold superior information about future payrolls. Steepening trades can also predict the rise of stock prices within a few hours before subsequent FOMC announcements, implying that the pre-FOMC stock drift is driven by informed speculation. Overall, evidence highlights spread traders' superior information and its important role in explaining announcement returns and pre-announcement drifts.
G14|Pricing Poseidon: Extreme Weather Uncertainty and Firm Return Dynamics|We investigate the uncertainty dynamics surrounding extreme weather events through the lens of option and stock markets by identifying market responses to the uncertainty regarding both potential hurricane landfall and subsequent economic impact. Stock options on firms with establishments exposed to the landfall region exhibit increases in implied volatility of 5-10 percent, reflecting impact uncertainty. Using hurricane forecasts, we show that landfall uncertainty and potential impact uncertainty are reflected in prices before landfall. We find no evidence that markets incorporate better hurricane forecasts than those from NOAA. Improvements to hurricane forecasts could have economically significant effects in financial markets.
G14|Transparency and Collateral: The Design of CCPs' Loss Allocation Rules|This paper adopts a mechanism design approach to study optimal clearing arrangements for bilateral financial contracts in which an assessment of counterparty risk is crucial for efficiency. The economy is populated by two types of agents: a borrower and lender. The borrower is subject to limited commitment and holds private information about the severity of such lack of commitment. The lender can acquire information at a cost about the commitment of the borrower, which affects the assessment of counterparty risk. When truthful revelation by the borrower is not incentive compatible, the mechanism designer optimally trades off the value of information about the lack of commitment of the borrower with the cost of incentivizing the lender to acquire such information. Central clearing of these financial contracts through a central counterparty (CCP) allows lenders to mutualize their counterparty risks, but this insurance may weaken incentives to acquire and reveal informatio n about such risks. If information acquisition is incentive compatible, then lenders choose central clearing. If it is not, they may prefer bilateral clearing to prevent strategic default by borrowers and to economize on costly collateral. Central clearing is analyzed under different institutional features observed in financial markets, which place different restrictions on the contract space in the mechanism design problem. The interaction between the costly information acquisition and the limited commitment friction differs significantly in each clearing arrangement and in each set of restrictions. This results in novel lessons about the desirability of central versus bilateral clearing depending on traders' characteristics and the institutional features defining the operation of the CCP.
G14|Variance Disparity and Market Frictions|This paper introduces a new model-free approach to measuring the expectation of market variance using VIX derivatives. This approach shows that VIX derivatives carry different information about future variance than S&P 500 (SPX) options, especially during the 2008 financial crisis. I find that the segmentation is associated with frictions such as funding illiquidity, market illiquidity, and asymmetric information. When they are segmented, VIX derivatives contribute more to the variance discovery process than SPX options. These findings imply that VIX derivatives would offer a better estimate of expected variance than SPX options, and that a measure of segmentation may be useful for policymakers as it signals the severity of frictions.
G14|Who Sees the Trades? The Effect of Information on Liquidity in Inter-Dealer Markets|Dealers, who strategically supply liquidity to traders, are subject to both liquidity and adverse selection costs. While liquidity costs can be mitigated through inter-dealer trading, individual dealers’ private motives to acquire information compromise inter-dealer market liquidity. Post-trade information disclosure can improve market liquidity by counteracting dealers’ incentives to become better informed through their market-making activities. Asymmetric disclosure, however, exacerbates the adverse selection problem in inter-dealer markets, in turn decreasing equilibrium liquidity provision. A non-monotonic relationship may arise between the partial release of post-trade information and market liquidity. This points to a practical concern: a strategic post-trade platform has incentives to maximize adverse selection and may choose to release information in a way that minimizes equilibrium liquidity provision.
G14|An Information-based Theory of Financial Intermediation|We advance a theory of intermediation that builds on private information and heterogeneous screening ability across market participants. We solve for the equilibrium market structure and show that investors with high screening ability are the largest intermediators: they are the most central in trade, they trade frequently, they trade with many different counterparties, and they extract high rents. We derive a set of testable predictions from the model and we test them using transaction-level micro data. Our empirical results provide evidence that our mechanism relying on private information and screening ability is a relevant feature of intermediation in over-the-counter markets.
G14|Reconsidering Rational Expectations and the Aggregation of Diverse Information in Laboratory Security Markets|The ability of markets to aggregate diverse information is a cornerstone of economics and finance, and empirical evidence for such aggregation has been demonstrated in previous laboratory experiments. Most notably Plott and Sunder (1988) find clear support for the rational expectations hypothesis in their Series B and C markets. However, recent studies have called into question the robustness of these findings. In this paper, we report the result of a direct replication of the key information aggregation results presented in Plott and Sunder. We do not find the same strong evidence in support of rational expectations that Plott and Sunder report suggesting information aggregation is a fragile property of markets.
G14|Smart Development Banks|The conventional paradigm about development banks is that these institutions exist to target well-identified market failures. However, market failures are not directly observable and can only be ascertained with a suitable learning process. Hence, the question is how do the policymakers know what activities should be promoted, how do they learn about the obstacles to the creation of new activities? Rather than assuming that the government has arrived at the right list of market failures and uses development banks to close some well-identified market gaps, we suggest that development banks can be in charge of identifying these market failures through their loan-screening and lending activities to guide their operations and provide critical inputs for the design of productive development policies. In fact, they can also identify government failures that stand in the way of development and call for needed public inputs. This intelligence role of development banks is similar to the role that modern theories of financial intermediation assign to banks as institutions with a comparative advantage in producing and processing information. However, while private banks focus on information on private returns, development banks would potentially produce and organize information about social returns.
G14|Analysing monetary policy statements of the Reserve Bank of India|In this paper we quantitatively analyse monetary policy statements of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from 1998 to 2017, across the regimes of five governors. We first ask whether the content and focus of the statements have changed with the adoption of inflation-targeting as a framework for conducting monetary policy. Next, we study the influence of various aspects of monetary policy communication on structural complexity that capture governor-specific trends in communication. We find that while RBI's monetary policy communication is linguistically complex on average, the length of monetary policy statements has gone down and readability has improved significantly in the recent years. We also find that there has been a persistent semantic shift in RBI's monetary policy communication since the adoption of inflation-targeting. Finally, using a simple regression model we find that lengthier and less readable statements are linked to both higher trading volumes and higher returns volatility in the equity markets, though the effects are not persistent.
G14|Effect of Stock Price Information on Timing of Share Repurchases|Objective – This study investigates whether private information newly incorporated into stock price enhances performance in timing share repurchases. Methodology/Technique – Cost saving gained in share repurchases is used a proxy for performance of market-timing in share repurchases and firm-specific stock return variation is used to gauge stock price informativeness. A sample of 334 U.S. repurchasing firms are tested using panel data regression. Findings – The paper concludes that managers possess better market timing skill by obtaining more cost saving from their share repurchases when private information is reflected in stock price. Stock price informativeness may be the tool for managers to improve their market timing skill to take advantage of the stock market. Furthermore, firms with smaller size and a higher market-to-book ratios, and firms with higher cash-to-assets ratios are found to achieve more cost saving in buying back their shares indicating that these firms are able to time the market in share repurchasing. Novelty – Despite numerous previous studies focusing solely on using share repurchases announcement for computing cumulative abnormal returns in testing managerial market timing, this study contributes to the literature in several ways: (i) providing evidence relating stock price informativeness and performance of market-timing in share repurchases; (ii) developing a better timing measure constructed using actual repurchasing data; (iii) adopting a cost saving measure as the timing measure instead of cumulative abnormal return. Type of Paper: Empirical.
G14|How Impactful is Telecom Efficiency to Company Stock Value?|Objective - The telecom industry is one of the optimistic industries that is still growing. In South East Asia, between 2008-2017, the number of subscribers increased 10.07% annually, and revenue for the industry grew 6.08% annually. However, Net Profit Margin, EBITDA, and EBIT value during the same period declined at the time revenue amount was increasing. One of the visible health factors and part of the valuation factor is stock value. Hence the research question of this study is: What is the impact and significance of telecom operators' efficiency to stock value? Methodology/Technique - In this study, efficiency will be measured and analyzed using Stochastic Frontier Approach (SFA) method. By using same method, the impact of efficiency to stock value will be measured, as well as the significance level. Finding - The results of this research show that from 14 telecom operators observed, TLKM (Indonesia) obtained the highest efficiency score (0.984) whereas StarHub (Malaysia) had the lowest efficiency score (0.405). TLKM (Indonesia) and AIS (Thailand) had a similar efficiency score given the fact that the behaviour of the subscribers is similar and they have the same country characteristic. Novelty - All of the input and output variables have a positive impact on the efficiency parameter except Total Asset which has negative impact on the efficiency score. By using further analysis of the t-Ratio between the variables and efficiency, it can be seen that stock value is impacted by the efficiency parameters but this impact is not significant (t-Ratio 1.35). Type of Paper - Empirical.
G14|How Does Asymmetric Information Create Market Incompleteness?|The aim of this work is to show that incompleteness is due in general not only to a lack of assets, but also to a lack of information. In this paper we present a simple inuence model where the inuencial agent has access to additional information. This leads to the construction of two models, a complete model and an incomplete model where the only dierence is a dierence of information. This leads to a simple model of incomplete market where the number of assets is not the cause of incompleteness: incomplete information is the explanation.

G14|Without coal in the age of steam and dams in the age of electricity: An explanation for the failure of Portugal to industrialize before the Second World War|We provide a natural resource explanation for the divergence of the Portuguese economy relative to other European countries before the Second World War, based on a considerable body of contemporary sources. First, we demonstrate that a lack of domestic resources meant that Portugal experienced limited and unbalanced growth during the age of steam. Imports of coal were prohibitively expensive for inland areas, which failed to industrialize. Coastal areas developed through steam, but were constrained by limited demand from the interior. Second, we show that after the First World War, when other coal-poor countries turned to hydro-power, Portugal relied on coal-based thermal-power, creating a vicious circle of high energy prices and labor-intensive industrialization. We argue that this was the result of (i) water resources which were relatively expensive to exploit; and (ii) path-dependency, whereby the failure to develop earlier meant that there was a lack of capital and demand from industry.
G14|Full steam ahead: Insider knowledge, stock trading and the nationalization of the railways in Prussia around 1879|The costs and benefits of insider trading is a persistent topic in the economic literature and public discourse alike. Nowadays insider trading is principally illegal and morally banned implying that the costs are supposed to weigh heavier than the potential benefits. We study insider trading pre-1914 in order to shed new light on its extent when it was still legal. Our focus is on the first wave of railway nationalisation in Prussia around 1879, the biggest financial transaction in German economic history by this time. Anecdotal evidence has it that insiders – e.g. involved banks or single bankers – made decent use of their exclusive knowledge on how nationalisation would proceed, thereby incurring huge profits. We show that insiders were active at the Berlin Stock Exchange, but contrary to anecdotal evidence could be so only in a very small time-window limiting their options sustainably. Contrary to what Braggion and Moore (2013) found for the London Stock Exchange, the rather modest extent of insider trading was not due to insiders’ ethical reservations, but due to the stock exchange’s institutional design that limited excessive insider trading in the absence of laws against it.
G14|The Impact of ESG on Stocks’ Downside Risk and Risk Adjusted Return|Investments considering corporate social responsibility continue to expand. Are companies pursuing a CSR agenda benefiting shareholders by reducing their financial downside risk? This paper investigates the relationship between a firm’s environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) scores and its downside risk on the stock market. We study this link using a panel of 887 stocks listed in five European countries over the period 2005-2017. Our empirical results show that higher ESG scores are associated with reduced downside risk of stock returns. Based on the Fama-French three factor model, we found no systematic relationship between ESG and the level of risk-adjusted return.
G14|A critique of momentum anomalies|This paper offers theoretical, empirical, and simulated evidence that momentum regularities in asset prices are not anomalies. Within a general, frictionless, rational expectations, risk-based asset pricing framework, riskier assets tend to be in the loser portfolios after (large) increases in the price of risk. Hence, the risk of momentum portfolios usually decreases with the prevailing price of risk, and their risk premiums are approximately negative quadratic functions of the price of risk (and the market premium) theoretically truncated at zero. The best linear (CAPM) function describing this relation unconditionally has exactly the negative slope and positive intercept documented empirically.
G14|Macro-finance and factor timing: Time-varying factor risk and price of risk premiums|This paper documents empirically that increases in the book-to-market spread predict larger market premiums in sample and larger size, value, and investment premiums (also) out of sample. In addition, increases in the investment (or profitability) spread exclusively predict larger investment (or profitability) premiums. This predictability generates “factor timing” strategies that deliver substantial economic gains out of sample. I argue theoretically that the book-to-market spread is a price of risk proxy, while the investment and profitability spreads are factor risk proxies. The evidence confirms standard theoretical predictions in the macro-finance literature and contradicts the hypothesis of constant factor risks.
G14|Predictability concentrates in bad times. And so does disagreement|Within a standard risk-based asset pricing framework with rational expectations, realized returns have two components: Predictable risk premiums and unpredictable shocks. In bad times, the price of risk increases. Hence, the predictable fraction of returns – and predictability – increases. “Disagreement” (dispersion in analyst forecasts) also intensifies in bad times if (i) analysts report (close to) risk-neutral expectations weighted by state prices, which become more volatile, or (ii) dividend volatility changes with the price of risk – for example, because consumption volatility changes. In both cases, individual analysts produce unbiased forecasts based on partial information.
G14|The Effect of Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) on Bank Lending during the Euro Area Crisis|We examine the impact of Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) on bank lending in eleven euro area countries. With the intensification of the financial crisis, ELA came to take on an almost systemic role in some countries (notably Greece), with either the whole or large parts of national banking systems depending on it. Despite this crucial role, assessments of the quantitative impact of ELA in the literature are non-existent. This paper aims to fill this gap. We estimate a structural panel model for the determination of bank lending, which includes the amount of ELA received by each bank, allowing us to investigate the direct effect of ELA on bank lending. Our model corrects a key mis-specification found in the prototype model used in the literature on bank lending. We then undertake a VAR analysis, which allows us to address the effect of ELA on GDP. Finally, we examine spillover effects among banks. Our results suggest that the provision of ELA generated positive spillovers to other banks.
G14|Estimating the monetary policy interest-rate-to-performance sensitivity of the European banking sector at the zero lower bound|Using an event-study design, we investigate monetary policy interest-rate-to-performance sensitivity of the European banking sector over the 07/2012–06/2017 period when interest rates were (close to) zero. We apply the Wordscores approach to introductory statements of ECB's Governing Council press conferences to estimate a ‘shadow prime rate’. Based on short-run intraday event windows, we find shadow prime rate changes positively affect changes in the EURO-STOXX-Banks Future. Our findings add to the recent evidence documenting that banks benefit from increasing interest rate levels in a low-interest-rate environment.
G14|Complexity of ECB Communication and Financial Market Trading|We examine how the verbal complexity of ECB communications affects financial market trading based on high-frequency data from European stock index futures trading. Studying the 34 events between May 2009 and June 2017, during which the ECB Governing Council press conferences covered unconventional monetary policy measures, and using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level to measure the verbal complexity of introductory statements to the press conferences, we find that more complex communications are associated with a lower level of contemporaneous trading. Increasing complexity of introductory statements leads to a temporal shift of trading activity towards the subsequent Q&A session, which suggests that Q&A sessions facilitate market participants’ information processing.
G14|Public attention to environmental issues and stock market returns|This paper empirically examines the effect of public attention to climate change and pollution on the weekly returns on US sustainability stock indices (i.e. the DJSI US and the FTSE4Good USA Index) in comparison to their conventional counterparts (i.e. the S&P 500 Index and the FTSE USA). In addition to unexpected global climate-related natural weather disasters, we consider two complementary measures of public attention to these environmental issues: (i) US media attention to climate change and pollution and (ii) the US Google Search Volume Index for these two keywords. Robust to several sensitivity analyses, our econometric analysis for the period from 2004 to 2018 reveals that public attention to environmental issues has a significantly positive (negative) effect on the returns on US sustainability (conventional) stock indices. A possible explanation of this result is that high public attention to environmental issues may drive traditionally sustainable investors, neo-sustainable, and opportunistic self-interested investors to favor stocks of sustainable firms. The insights from our empirical study are important for private and institutional investors, managers of firms, and public policy.
G14|On the (in)efficiency of cryptocurrencies: Have they taken daily or weekly random walks?|The legitimacy of virtual currencies as an alternative form of monetary exchange has been the centre of an ongoing heated debated since the catastrophic global financial meltdown of 2007-2008. We contribute to the relative fresh body of empirical research on the informational market efficiency of cryptomarkets by investigating the weak-form efficiency of the top-five cryptocurrencies. In differing from previous studies, we implement random walk testing procedures which are robust to asymmetries and unobserved smooth structural breaks. Moreover, our study employs two frequencies of cryptocurrency returns, one corresponding to daily returns and the other to weekly returns. Our findings validate the random walk hypothesis for daily series hence validating the weak-form efficiency for daily returns. On the other hand, weekly returns are observed to be stationary processes which is evidence against weak-form efficiency for weekly returns. Overall, our study has important implications for market participants within cryptocurrency markets.
G14|The human capital-economic growth nexus in SSA countries: What can strengthen the relationship?|The World Bank has recently placed increasing emphasis on the role of human capital development in facilitating economic development in the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) region. Our study examines the impact of human capital on economic growth for a selected sample of 9 SSA countries between 1980 and 2016 using a panel econometric approach. Interestingly enough, our empirical analysis shows an insignificant effect of human capital on economic growth for our selected sample. These findings remain unchanged even after adding interactive terms to human capital which are representative of government spending as well as foreign direct investment. Nevertheless, we establish a positive and significant effect of the interactive term between urbanization and human capital on economic growth, a result which emphasizes the importance of developing urbanized, ‘smart’, technologically-driven cities within the SSA region as a platform towards strengthening the impact of human capital- economic growth relationship.
G14|Covered interest rate parity, relative funding liquidity and cross-currency repos|Deviations from the covered interest rate parity (CIP) are considerably smaller or even zero when calculated based on a particular set of repo rates, so-called cross-currency repo rates, instead of standard interest rates, such as overnight indexed swap or Interbank Offered rates. We attribute this (partial) solution of the CIP puzzle to the nearly identical risk characteristics of foreign exchange swaps and cross-currency repos: both are virtually devoid of counterparty credit risk but incorporate a relative funding liquidity premium. In practice, CIP deviations can thus be exploited on a truly riskless basis using cross-currency repo transactions, which is not the case for other interest rates.
G14|Law Change in a Regulated Sector Impacts Other Regulated Sectors: Evidence from Brazil|This paper shows that a change in systematic risk of a regulated sector affects the regulatory environment by changing also the systematic risk of other sectors not directly affected by the intervention. We consider the Provisional Act. no. 579/2012 (PA 579) aimed at reducing power fees for Brazilian consumers. However, it has led to other consequences, including uncertainties about the rules for renewals of existing concessions. The analysis of systematic risk uses time-varying betas from 140 companies listed on the Brazilian Stock Market between January 2008 and September 2016. Based on both synthetic control and Dif-in-Dif methodologies, we conclude that the PA 579 increased the systemic risk not only of the sector it regulates, but also of other regulated sector in Brazil, suggesting a contagion effect on the country's regulatory environment.
G14|Dynamic Incentives for Buy-Side Analysts|We develop a dynamic adverse selection model where a career-concerned buy-side analyst advises a fund manager about investment decisions. The analyst's ability is privately known, as is any information she learns over time. The manager wants to elicit information to maximize fund performance while also identifying and retaining high-skill analysts. We characterize the optimal dynamic contract, show that it has several features supported by empirical evidence, and derive novel testable implications. The fund manager's optimal contract both maximizes the value of information and screens out low-skill analysts by incentivizing the analyst to always provide honest advice.
G14|Using the Tools of Industrial Organization to Illuminate the Credit Rating Industry|Until slightly more than a decade ago, the credit rating industry was largely a little-recognized and little-understood part of the financial system â€œplumbingâ€ . This obscurity changed with the financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath. After a few years of intensive attention, however, the CRAs have retreated back to semi-obscurity and attract little media or political attention. The tools of industrial organization (IO) can help us understand this industry: its structure; its behavior; and its outcomes; and the public policies that are likely to improve its functioning.
G14|FTSE/JSE Index Migration: Testing for the Index Effect in Stocks Entering and Exiting the Top 40|This paper seeks to uncover whether periodic changes to the constituents in the Top 40 index lead to price distortions during quarterly index rebalancing. The premise for this research follows from the notable increase in assets under management of index tracker funds both globally and locally, in recent years. A larger asset base tracking a given index would imply larger volumes of forced buying and selling by passive tracker funds when changes are made to the constituents underlying the index. This follows as the passive trackers are tracking error sensitive as opposed to being price sensitive, which should lead to predictable excesses in demand for stocks entering and supply of stocks exiting the index. The objective of this research is to uncover whether these dynamics result in price distortions in the local index, and in particular whether it can be profitably exploited by front-running anticipated changes. Our study indeed confirms the existence of a highly profitable index effect, conditional upon timing trading actions correctly and being able to accurately predict entrants and deletions ahead of the public announcement.
G14|Nowhere to Run, Nowhere to Hide - Asset Diversification in a Flat World|We estimate trends in diversification potential for equity, debt, and real estate within and across asset classes and countries. After 2000, we uncover a marked and near ubiquitous decline in diversification potential, which coincides with sharply higher levels of investment risk. This decline is associated with gains in market liquidity, country economic development, and internet diffusion. Diversification potential also waned temporarily during the 1992 ERM and 2009-2010 European sovereign debt crises. The results are robust to controls for macro-financial influences, investor sentiment, and proxies for economic, political, and financial risks. Findings offer a cautionary note regarding asset class and geographic diversification of investment risk in an increasingly flat world.
G14|Co-skewness across Return Horizons|In this paper, the impact of investment horizon on asset co-skewness is examined both empirically and theoretically. We detail a strong horizon-based estimation bias for co-skewness. An asset that has positive co-skewness in one horizon may have negative co-skewness in another. This phenomenon is particularly evident for small-capitalization stocks. We propose a theoretical model to estimate long-horizon co-skewness using the shortest horizon data, which emphasizes the role of adjustment delays in pricing market-wide information among securities. Moreover, in the absence of intertemporal correlation, we show that co-skewness remains horizon-dependent. Our findings are robust to alternative specifications and have strong implications for asset pricing or portfolio allocation with co-skewness.
G14|Market risk when hedging a global credit portfolio|Hedging a credit portfolio using single name CDS is affected by high spread volatility that induces continuous changes in a portfolio mark to market, which is a nuisance. Often, the problem is that CDS on firms in the portfolio are not being traded. To get around that, a derivative portfolio can be hedged by taking a contrary position in a credit index, and we examine in this paper the efficiency of such an imperfect hedge. We find over the 2007-2012 period an 80% hedging efficiency for a European portfolio, 60% for North American and Japanese portfolios, and around 70% for a global portfolio, as measured by the reduction in mark-to-market variance. We also consider sectorial credit portfolios for Europe and North America, for which hedging efficiency is not as high, due to their more import- ant idiosyncratic component. Taking into account the quality of the credit counterpart improves the effectiveness of the hedge, although it requires using less liquid credit indices, with higher transaction costs. Standard conditional volatility models provide similar results to the least squares hedge, except for extreme market movements. An efficient hedge for a credit portfolio made up of the most idiosyn- cratic firms would seem to require more than 50 firms, while the hedge for portfolios made up of the less idiosyncratic firms achieves high efficiency even for a small number of firms. The efficiency of the hedge is higher when portfolio volatility is high and also when short term interest rates or exchange rate volatility are high. Increases in VIX, in the 10-year swap rate or in liquidity risk tend to decrease hedging efficiency. Credit indices offer a moderately efficient hedge for corporate bond portfolios, which we have examined with a reduced sample of firms over 2006-2018. This analysis also shows that the current efficiency of a credit index hedge has recovered at pre-crisis levels.
G14|Price discovery in a continuous-time setting|We formulate a continuous-time price discovery model and investigate how the standard price discovery measures vary with respect to the sampling interval. We ï¬ nd that the component share measure is invariant to the sampling interval, and hence, discrete-sampled prices suï¬ƒce to identify the continuous-time component share. In contrast, information share estimates are not comparable across diï¬€erent sampling intervals because the contemporaneous correlation between markets increases in magnitude as the sampling interval grows. We show how to back out the continuous-time information share from discrete-sampled prices under cer-tain assumptions on the contemporaneous correlation. We assess our continuous-time model by comparing the estimates of the (continuous-time) component and information shares at diï¬€erent sampling intervals for 30 stocks in the US. We ï¬ nd that both price discovery measures are typ-ically stable across the diï¬€erent sampling intervals, suggesting that our continuous-time price discovery model ï¬ ts the data very well.
G14|Does the World Bank Move Markets?|This paper examines the impact of World Bank loans on borrowing country equity markets. We exploit a rich dataset with World Bank loan commitments and stock market returns at the monthly level, allowing us to study short run market reactions to news about loan commitments. Given ex ante uncertainty over the influx of resources, we expect a positive overall response to loan size in terms of the local stock market returns. To address potential endogeneity, we use a supply-push instrument based on countries' historic budget shares and the overall World Bank budget. Estimation results point to a sizable positive short run impact of World Bank loan commitments on local markets that may reduce the cost of capital for local entrepreneurs.
G14|Spot and Futures Prices of Bitcoin: Causality, Cointegration and Price Discovery from a Time-Varying Perspective|This paper investigates the causal relationships, cointegration and price discovery between spot and futures markets of Bitcoin using the daily data from a time-varying perspective for the first time in the literature. We apply the time-varying Granger causality test of Shi et al. (2018) to explore the causal relationship between spot and futures markets and find that futures prices Granger cause spot prices. We identify the existence of a cointegration relationship under the consideration of a time-varying cointegrating coefficient between spot and futures prices based on the Park and Hahn (1999) test. We also explore the time-varying price discovery process and find that futures prices dominate in the process, implying a leading informational role.
G14|Robustness of Support Vector Machines in Algorithmic Trading on Cryptocurrency Market|This study investigates the profitability of a algorithmic trading strategy based on training SVM model to identify cryptocurrencies with high or low predicted returns. A tail set is defined to be a group of coins whose volatility-adjusted returns are in the highest or lowest quantile. Each cryptocurrency is represented by a set of six technical features. SVM is trained on historical tail sets and tested on the current data. The classifier is chosen to be a nonlinear support vector machine. Portfolio is formed by ranking coins using SVM output. The highest ranked coins are used for long positions to be included in the portfolio for one reallocation period. The following metrics were used to estimate the portfolio profitability: %ARC (the annualized rate of change), %ASD (the annualized standard deviation of daily returns), MDD (the maximum drawdown coefficient), IR1, IR2 (the information ratio coefficients). The performance of the SVM portfolio is compared to the performance of the four benchmark strategies based on the values of the information ratio coefficient IR1 which quantifies the risk-weighted gain. The question on how sensitive the portfolio performance is to the parameters set in the SVM model is also addressed in this study.
G14|Does the inclusion of exposure to volatility into diversified portfolio improve the investment results? Portfolio construction from the perspective of a Polish investor|The main goal of this research is to analyse the investment benefits from an incorporation of the volatility exposure to the diversified portfolio from the perspective of a Polish investor. Volatility, treated as a new asset class, may improve the performance of the portfolio due to its negative correlation with most types of assets. This topic has been widely investigated for the United States and Europe whereas Polish market appears to be not heavily researched and this study may fill this gap. The research covers the period from October 2010 to July 2018 and is performed on the daily close prices. To construct the portfolios, the analysis uses the mean-variance framework and the naïve diversification approach. The comparison of risk-adjusted returns between investments with and without volatility exposure enables to answer the research question about an improvement of the results by the addition of a non-standard asset to the diversified portfolios. The VXX is considered as the proxy for volatility as it is the most popular ETN which follows the volatility index derivatives with the given maturity. To test the robustness of the results, the portfolios are constructed with a broad range of different parameters and assumptions imposed on the optimization procedure.
G14|Hybrid Investment Strategy Based on Momentum and Macroeconomic Approach|The purpose of this research is to test the potential returns and robustness of an automated investment strategy. The strategy is based on momentum and macroeconomic approach, that consists of the technical core – momentum, and the additional macro screening, which is used to determine whether investment signals generate relevant investment opportunities or just technical noise. In order to check whether the macroeconomic factor is the value added to the momentum strategy, the hybrid approach is tested and compared with the simple momentum and the macroeconomic strategy alone and then assessed on a risk-adjusted return basis. The main aim of this paper is to answer the question, whether an investor can gain surplus risk-adjusted returns from merging short-term momentum strategy with the long-term macroeconomic approach. Strategies are based on the data for the selected companies from the S&P500 index in the period ranging from 02/01/1990 to 31/12/2018.
G14|Liquidity in the German stock market|This paper presents the most extensive analysis of liquidity in the German equity market so far. We examine the evolution of liquidity over time, the determinants of liquidity, and commonality across liquidity measures and countries. We make use of a new publicly available dataset, the Market Microstructure Database Xetra (MMDB-Xetra). We find that liquidity has generally increased over time, and that in times of crisis liquidity is lower and the volatility of liquidity is significantly higher. Commonality in liquidity is highest during the financial crisis. We also find significant commonality between liquidity in the US and the German equity markets.
G14|Volatility and Informativeness|We explore the equilibrium relation between price volatility and price informativeness in financial markets, with the ultimate goal of characterizing the type of inferences that can be drawn about price informativeness by observing price volatility. We identify two different channels (noise reduction and equilibrium learning) through which changes in price informativeness are associated with changes in price volatility. We show that when informativeness is sufficiently high (low) volatility and informativeness positively (negatively) comove in equilibrium for any change in primitives. In the context of our leading application, we provide conditions on primitives that guarantee that volatility and informativeness always comove positively or negatively. We use data on U.S. stocks between 1963 and 2017 to recover stock-specific primitives and find that most stocks lie in the region of the parameter space in which informativeness and volatility comove negatively.
G14|Trading Costs and Informational Efficiency|We study the effect of trading costs on information aggregation and acquisition in financial markets. For a given precision of investors' private information, an irrelevance result emerges when investors are ex-ante identical: price informativeness is independent of the level of trading costs. When investors are ex-ante heterogeneous, anything goes, and a change in trading costs can increase or decrease price informativeness, depending on the source of heterogeneity. Our results are valid under quadratic, linear, and fixed costs. Through a reduction in information acquisition, trading costs reduce price informativeness. We discuss how our results inform the policy debate on financial transaction taxes/Tobin taxes.
G14|Can the Market Multiply and Divide? Non-Proportional Thinking in Financial Markets|Nominal stock prices are arbitrary. Therefore, when evaluating how a piece of news should affect the price of a stock, rational investors should think in percentage rather than dollar terms. However, dollar price changes are ubiquitously reported and discussed. This may both cause and reflect a tendency of investors to think about the impact of news in dollar terms, leading to more extreme return responses to news for lower-priced stocks. We find a number of results consistent with such non-proportional thinking. First, lower-priced stocks have higher total volatility, idiosyncratic volatility, and market betas, after controlling flexibly for size. To identify a causal effect of price, we show that volatility increases sharply following pre-announced stock splits and drops following reverse stock splits. The returns of lower-priced stocks also respond more strongly to firm-specific news events, all else equal. The economic magnitudes are large: a doubling in a stock's nominal price is associated with a 20-30% decline in its volatility, beta, and return response to firm-specific news. These patterns are not exclusive to small, illiquid stocks; they hold even among the largest stocks. Non-proportional thinking can explain a variety of asset pricing anomalies such as long-run and short-run reversals, as well as the negative relation between past returns and volatility (i.e., the leverage effect). Our analysis also shows that the well-documented negative relation between risk (volatility or beta) and size is actually driven by nominal prices rather than fundamentals.
G14|Institutional Trading Around M&A Announcements|Takeover targets often experience substantial share price appreciations around public announcements of mergers and acquisitions. We analyze hedge fund and mutual fund holdings around takeover announcements to assess the differences in investment strategies across institutions. Our results indicate that hedge funds in the aggregate increase their holdings of soon-to-be takeover targets by 7.2% during the quarter prior to the public announcement. Conversely, mutual funds reduce their equity holdings in impending targets by 3.0% during the quarter before M&A announcements and therefore potentially forgo profitable investment opportunities.
G14|Can Financial Participants Improve Price Discovery and Efficiency in Multi-Settlement Markets with Trading Costs?|The introduction of purely financial participants into commodity markets is thought to yield forward prices that better reflect future spot prices, and ultimately, more efficient future production and consumption decisions. However, there are sizable transaction costs associated with trading in most commodity markets. This paper develops a statistical test of the null hypothesis that expected forward/spot price spreads cannot be arbitraged even after accounting for these transactions costs. We apply this test to hourly, location-specific day-ahead and real-time prices from California's wholesale electricity market. The implied trading cost required to reject the null hypothesis of no profitable arbitrage opportunities falls significantly after California allowed purely financial participation. Moreover, variable input costs per MWh of electricity produced fell by 3.6% in high demand hours after the introduction of purely financial participants. Combined, our evidence supports the hypothesis that the introduction of purely financial participants into the California wholesale electricity market decreased the average difference and the volatility of the difference between day-ahead and real-time prices, which ultimately lowered the total variable cost of serving demand
G14|Business Groups and the Incorporation of Firm-specific Shocks into Stock Prices|In lower-income economies, stocks exhibit less idiosyncratic volatility and business groups are more prevalent. This study connects these two findings by showing that business group affiliated firms’ stock returns exhibit less idiosyncratic volatility than do the returns of otherwise similar unaffiliated firms. Global commodity price shocks are common shocks that contribute to firm-level idiosyncratic risk because they affect industries heterogeneously. Idiosyncratic components of commodity shocks are incorporated less into idiosyncratic returns of group affiliates than unaffiliated firms in the same industry and economy. Identification follows from difference-in-difference tests exploiting successful and matched-exogenously-failed control block transactions.
G14|Skill and Fees in Active Management|Greater skill of active investment managers can mean less fee revenue in a general equilibrium. Although more-skilled managers earn more revenue than less-skilled managers, greater skill for active managers overall can imply less revenue for their industry. Greater skill allows managers to identify mispriced securities more accurately and thereby make better portfolio choices. Greater skill also means, however, that active management corrects prices better and thus reduces managers' return opportunities. The latter effect can outweigh managers' better portfolio choices in equilibrium. Investors then rationally allocate less to active funds and more to index funds if active management is more skilled.
G14|Security Analysis: An Investment Perspective|The investment theory, in which the expected return varies cross-sectionally with investment, expected profitability, and expected growth, is a good start to understanding Graham and Dodd’s (1934) Security Analysis. Empirically, the q^5 model goes a long way toward explaining prominent equity strategies rooted in security analysis, including Frankel and Lee’s (1998) intrinsic-to-market value, Piotroski’s (2000) fundamental score, Greenblatt’s (2005) “magic formula,” Asness, Frazzini, and Pedersen’s (2019) quality-minus-junk, Buffett’s Berkshire, Bartram and Grinblatt’s (2018) agnostic analysis, as well as Penman and Zhu’s (2014, 2018) and Lewellen’s (2015) expected-return strategies.
G14|Are Analyst Trade Ideas Valuable?|Using a novel database, we show that the stock-price impact of analyst trade ideas is at least as large as the impact of stock recommendation, target price, and earnings forecast changes, and that investors following trade ideas can earn significant abnormal returns. Trade ideas triggered by forthcoming firm catalyst events are more informative than ideas exploiting temporary mispricing. Institutional investors trade in the direction of trade ideas and commission-paying institutional clients do so earlier than non-clients. Analysts generating trade ideas are more established and are more likely to produce ideas for stocks with high dollar trading commissions in their coverage universe.
G14|Credit Building or Credit Crumbling? A Credit Builder Loan’s Effects on Consumer Behavior, Credit Scores and Their Predictive Power|There is little evidence on how the large market for credit score improvement products affects consumers or credit market efficiency. A randomized encouragement design on a standard credit builder loan (CBL) identifies null average effects on whether consumers have a credit score and the score itself, with important heterogeneity: those with loans outstanding at baseline fare worse, those without fare better. Selection, treatment effect, and prediction models indicate the CBL reveals valuable information to markets, inducing positive selection and making credit histories more precise, while keeping credit scores’ predictive power intact. With modest targeting changes, CBLs could work as intended.
G14|The Value of Intermediation in the Stock Market|Brokers continue to play a critical role in intermediating institutional stock market transactions. More than half of all institutional investor order flow is still executed by high-touch (non-electronic) brokers. Despite the continued importance of brokers, we have limited information on what drives investors' choices among them. We develop and estimate an empirical model of broker choice that allows us to quantitatively examine each investor's responsiveness to execution costs and access to research and order flow information. Studying over 300 million institutional trades, we find that investor demand is relatively inelastic with respect to commissions and that investors are willing to pay a premium for access to top research analysts and order-flow information. There is substantial heterogeneity across investors. Relative to other investors, hedge funds tend to be more price insensitive, place less value on sell-side research, and place more value on order-flow information. Furthermore, using trader-level data, we find that investors are more likely to trade with traders who are located physically closer and are less likely to trade with traders that have misbehaved in the past. Lastly, we use our empirical model to investigate the unbundling of equity research and execution services related to the MiFID II regulations. While under-reporting for the average firm is relatively small (4%), we find that the bundling of execution and research allows some institutional investors to under-report management fees by up to 15%.
G14|Predicting Returns With Text Data|We introduce a new text-mining methodology that extracts sentiment information from news articles to predict asset returns. Unlike more common sentiment scores used for stock return prediction (e.g., those sold by commercial vendors or built with dictionary-based methods), our supervised learning framework constructs a sentiment score that is specifically adapted to the problem of return prediction. Our method proceeds in three steps: 1) isolating a list of sentiment terms via predictive screening, 2) assigning sentiment weights to these words via topic modeling, and 3) aggregating terms into an article-level sentiment score via penalized likelihood. We derive theoretical guarantees on the accuracy of estimates from our model with minimal assumptions. In our empirical analysis, we text-mine one of the most actively monitored streams of news articles in the financial system—the Dow Jones Newswires—and show that our supervised sentiment model excels at extracting return-predictive signals in this context.
G14|Noise trading and informational efficiency|We investigate how noise trading affects informational efficiency of financial markets. Using full order book data from the Australian Securities Exchange, we find that noise trading harms informational efficiency. However, this is driven mainly by higher levels of noise trading, indicating that not all noise trading has the same effects. Further, behind the aggregate effects lies rich heterogeneity in how noise trading affects informational efficiency cross-sectionally. Noise trading harms informational efficiency of large liquid stocks but can be beneficial in small illiquid stocks, indicating that markets interpret noise trading differently. Finally, our results suggest that current regulation such as European-wide financial transaction tax (FTT) could have unintended effects on market quality. Instead, carefully designing a tax policy considering both firm-level characteristics and different levels of noise trading is more likely to be an optimal regulatory response.
G14|Trading stocks on blocks: The quality of decentralized markets|The trust-free nature of blockchain-based systems challenges the role of traditional platform providers and enables the creation of new, intermediary-free markets. Despite the growing number of such markets, the impact of the blockchain's configuration on market outcomes remains unclear. In this study, we utilize order-level data from realworld financial markets to explore the impact of the blockchain parameters block size and block creation time on the quality of decentralized markets. More specifically, we find that increasing the blocks' capacity improves market activity, while higher block frequencies impose a trade-off between higher turnovers and lower trade sizes. In addition, we identify the block creation time and block size as core drivers of daily and intraday liquidity, respectively. In consequence, improving liquidity goes hand in hand with a higher activity. However, the reciprocal relationship between blockchain parameters and the increasing price impact of a block also indicate that faster and bigger blocks are no silver bullet to scale decentralized markets and may facilitate volatility. In total, we contribute an initial, technology-agnostic assessment of the quality of decentralized markets that aims to guide interdisciplinary researchers and innovative practitioners.
G14|Paying for market liquidity: Competition and incentives|Do competition and incentives offered to designated market makers (DMMs) improve market liquidity? Using data from NYSE Euronext Paris, we show that an exogenous increase in competition among DMMs leads to a significant decrease in quoted and effective spreads, mainly through a reduction in the realized spread. In contrast, changes in incentives, through small changes in rebates and requirements for DMMs, do not have any tangible effect on market liquidity. Our results are of relevance for designing optimal contracts between exchanges and DMMs, as well as for regulatory market oversight.
G14|High-frequency trading and price informativeness|We study how stock price informativeness changes with the presence of highfrequency trading (HFT). Our estimate is based on the staggered start of HFT participation in a panel of international exchanges. With HFT presence market prices are a less reliable predictor of future cash ows and investment, even more so for longer horizons. Further, idiosyncratic volatility decreases, mutual funds trade less actively and their holdings deviate less from the market-capitalization weighted portfolio. These findings suggest that price informativeness declines with HFT presence, consistent with theoretical models of HFTs' ability to anticipate informed order ow, reducing incentives to acquire fundamental information.
G14|Parimutuel Betting On The Esports Duels: Reverse Favourite-Longshot Bias And Its Determinants|We analyse betting behaviour patterns of the visitors of the specialized betting website dedicated to the popular eSports game Counter-Strike: Global O ensive. The reverse favourite-longshot bias is found both in the in-sample and out-of-sample datasets. This phenomenon is rather unusual for parimutuel betting markets because favourite-longshot bias is more common. We de ne simple betting strategies based on the bets on underdogs and show that these strategies make a suciently large positive pro t, which is a sign of market ineciency. Next, we investigate determinants of the reverse favourite-longshot bias. We hypothesize that popular teams attract more unsophisticated gamblers which adds to the stronger reverse favourite-longshot bias in matches with such teams. Geographical proximity is found to be a signi cant factor that increases the bias, whereas the e ect of internet popularity measured by the number of team players' followers on Twitter surprisingly follows the U-shape curve
G14|Nominal stock price anchors: A global phenomenon?|Weld et al. (2009) find that the average nominal U.S. stock price has been approximately $25 since the Great Depression. They report that this “nominal price fixation is primarily a U.S. or North American phenomenon.” Using a larger data set from 38 countries, we show that this nominal price fixation is a global phenomenon. We exploit the introduction of the euro in 1999 to show that stock splits maintain these nominal stock price anchors. Generally, firms in countries with larger drops in nominal prices had fewer stock splits after stock prices were displayed in euros.
G14|Discriminatory pricing of over-the-counter derivatives|New regulatory data reveal extensive discriminatory pricing in the foreign exchange derivatives market, in which dealer-banks and their non-financial clients trade over-the-counter. After controlling for contract characteristics, dealer fixed effects, and market conditions, we find that the client at the 75th percentile of the spread distribution pays an average of 30 pips over the market mid-price, compared to competitive spreads of less than 2.5 pips paid by the bottom 25% of clients. Higher spreads are paid by less sophisticated clients. However, trades on multi-dealer request-for-quote platforms exhibit competitive spreads regardless of client sophistication, thereby eliminating discriminatory pricing. JEL Classification: G14, G18, D4
G14|When do regulatory interventions work?|Previous studies find mixed results about how a fee on high order-to-trade (OTR) ratios impacts market quality. Using a natural experiment where such a fee was introduced twice for different reasons, this paper finds evidence of impact only when the implementation matched the motive. We use a difference-in-difference regression, that exploits microstructure features, to find causal evidence of lower aggregate OTR and higher market quality when the fee was used to manage limited exchange infrastructure, but little to no change in the OTRs or market quality when it was used for a regulatory need to slow down high frequency trading.
G14|Analysing monetary policy statements of the Reserve Bank of India|In this paper we quantitatively analyse monetary policy statements of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from 1998 to 2017, across the regimes of five governors. We first ask whether the content and focus of the statements have changed with the adoption of inflation-targeting as a framework for conducting monetary policy. Next, we study the influence of various aspects of monetary policy communication on financial markets. Using natural language processing tools, we construct measures of linguistic and structural complexity that capture governor-specific trends in communication. We find that while RBI’s monetary policy communication is linguistically complex on average, the length of monetary policy statements has gone down and readability has improved significantly in the recent years. We also find that there has been a persistent semantic shift in RBI’s monetary policy communication since the adoption of inflation-targeting. Finally, using a simple regression model we find that lengthier and less readable statements are linked to both higher trading volumes and higher returns volatility in the equity markets, though the effects are not persistent.
G14|Is Positive Sentiment in Corporate Annual Reports Informative? Evidence from Deep Learning|We use a novel text classification approach from deep learning to more accurately measure sentiment in a large sample of 10-Ks. In contrast to most prior literature, we find that positive, and negative, sentiment predicts abnormal return and abnormal trading volume around 10-K filing date and future firm fundamentals and policies. Our results suggest that the qualitative information contained in corporate annual reports is richer than previously found. Both positive and negative sentiments are informative when measured accurately, but they do not have symmetric implications, suggesting that a net sentiment measure advocated by prior studies would be less informative.
G14|The relationship between announcements of complete mergers and acquisitions and acquirers' abnormal CDS spread changes|Employing a sample of 492 merger and acquisition (M&A) announcements from 284 acquirers across North America and Europe between 2005 and 2018, this study analyzes the impact of M&A announcements on an acquirers abnormal CDS spread changes. We find that spreads from CDS which are written on acquirers increase by 310 bps during a symmetric five-day event window suggesting that investors expect an increase in the acquirers credit risk exposure due to M&As. Next to this baseline finding, we conduct a large variety of sensitivity analyses to gain more insight into the driving factors of the rising risk perception of CDS investors due to M&A announcements.
G14|Market Reaction to iPhone Rumors|The paper studies the effects of new product rumors about the iPhone on the stock price of the Apple company. We scrape iPhone rumors from Macrumors.com, and obtain a dataset covering 1,264 articles containing 180 words on average bet-ween January 2002 and December 2015. Moreover, we construct a market-decided lexicon to transform qualitative information into quantitative data, and analyze what type of words and what information embedded in the rumors are apt to impact on Apple's stock price. Unlike previous studies, we do not rely on the widely-adopted Harvard-IV-4 dictionary, as the coefficients of the words from the dictionary are neither significant nor consistent with their polarities, compared with our results. The paper obtains three main findings. First, the spread of rumors has a significant impact on the stock price. Second, positive words, rather than negative words, play an important role in affecting the stock price. Third, the stock price is highly sensitive to the words related to the appearance of the iPhone.
G14|The Impact of Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect on the Effectiveness of Price Limits in the Chinese Stock Market|Launched in 2014, the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect (SHSC) is the first mutual access channel between the Chinese and Hong Kong equity markets. The scheme allows Hong Kong and international investors to purchase eligible Shanghai-listed shares, while at the same time permitting eligible Chinese investors to purchase eligible Hong Kong-listed shares. This paper aims to examine the impact of the scheme on the effectiveness of the price limit rule, which is only imposed in China but not in Hong Kong. Results show that the scheme alleviates the delayed price discovery problem caused by price limits but has no significant effect on the problems of volatility spillover and trading interference.
G14|Complémentarité Banque islamique du Sénégal/institutions de microfinance : un modèle de financement inclusif et durable des PME sénégalaises<BR>[Complementarity Islamic Bank of Senegal/microfinance institutions: an inclusive and sustainable financing model for Senegalese SMEs]|The purpose of this article is to analyze the complementary relationship between the Islamic Bank of Senegal (BIS) and microfinance institutions (MFIs) and their contributions to the inclusive and sustainable financing of Senegalese SMEs. Indeed, in Senegal, the SMEs that make up almost the entire productive sector, 99.8% of the economic fabric, 3450.3 billion FCFA of turnover and more than 45% of the active population in 2016 (ANSD / RGE, 2016), have great difficulty in obtaining external and formal financing. The Senegalese financial system, which is predominantly dominated by banks and MFIs, gives SMEs a very limited chance to access financing. This is because the financing needs of SMEs are too important for MFIs but too low for banks to respond optimally to their needs. In addition, the banking sector, which has sufficient liquidity, is struggling to obtain financing mechanisms that are appropriate to the needs of SMEs. On the side of MFIs that have the appropriate financing tools, they are unable to find significant resources to meet the demand for funding of large SMEs. In this momentum, the complementarity between Islamic banking and MFIs seems to be the most appropriate and effective solution to address the financial difficulties of SMEs. Indeed, the research hypothesis of this article is that the refinancing partnership between these two financial structures favorably affects the financing of SMEs. Our panel data estimates confirm our main research hypothesis because they show positively and decisively the role of the complementarity relationship between these two financial institutions on the financing of SMEs.
G14|An analysis of the unbiased forward rate hypothesis in developed and emerging economies|This study assesses whether the unbiased forward rate hypothesis (UFRH) holds in its strong or weak form in selected developed and emerging economies. Moreover, the paper assesses whether this hypothesis, or the relationship between the forward and spot exchange rates, is better specified by a linear or nonlinear model. The paper makes use of the smooth transition error correction model (STECM) to account for long-run relationship and asymmetric adjustment between the two exchange rates. The results of the empirical analysis show the possibility of nonlinear cointegration between the spot and forward exchange rates in a number of developed and emerging economies. In addition, the results reveal that the magnitude of the speed of adjustment to cancel arbitrage opportunities is higher in emerging than in developed markets. This occurs because the size of arbitrage profit is higher in emerging markets compared to developed markets
G14|Hedge fund activism, voice, and value creation|We construct a novel hand-collected large data set of 205 U.S. hedge funds and 1031 activist events over the period 2005-2013, which records both the Schedule 13D filing date and the voicing date, and explore the role of voicing in value creation. We employ alternative inferential statistical approaches, including parametric, non-parametric, and heteroscedasticity-robust tests along with bootstrapping. We reveal that the voice date is important in creating short-term firm value, and provide strong evidence that voicing is associated with positive abnormal returns. These abnormal returns are approximately 1.11%, and are higher than the abnormal returns around the Schedule13D date by approximately 64%. There is also evidence of positive voice abnormal returns for voicing events which lead Schedule 13D events. The results are robust to models of abnormal returns allowing for leverage effects, and to alternative inferential statistical procedures. These findings suggest that voicing leads to information revelation, with implications for U.S. stock market arbitrage and the regulation for hedge fund activism information disclosure.
G14|Festivals and destination marketing: An application from Izmir City|Festivals are among the growing global city and destination attraction factors and they are very trendy. Studies indicate that there is a direct relationship between the successful organizations of festivals and the number of visitors and tourism income of a city destination. Thus, festival marketing efforts usually have a direct impact on city marketing efforts. Due to this fact, the study tries to figure out the festival marketing potential of Izmir city that seems to lag behind the general tourism development pattern of Turkey contrary to the great potential it has. The study comprises of two main sections, first one being a literature review on festival marketing, followed by the second section on a qualitative research on Izmir’s festivals and their marketing potential. It tries to determine the positive impacts of Izmir’s festivals on destination marketing and by grouping and categorizing them under similar characteristics figuring out the most promising ones. The research consists of four open-ended interview questions on festivals held in Izmir city. As practical implications, Destination Management Organizations, Destination Marketing Organizations, destination and city marketers, festival managers and destination tourism developers may benefit from the findings of this study.
G14|Institutional Investor Attention and Firm Disclosure|We study how short-term changes in institutional owner attention affect managers’ short-term disclosure choices. Holding institutional ownership constant and controlling for industry-quarter effects, we find that managers respond to attention by increasing the number of forecasts and 8-K filings. Rather than alter the decision of whether to forecast or to provide more informative disclosures, attention causes minor disclosure adjustments. Although attention explains significant variation in the quantity of disclosure, we find little change in abnormal volume and volatility, the bid-ask spread, or depth. Overall, our evidence suggests that management responds to temporary institutional investor attention by making disclosures that have little effect on information quality or liquidity.
G14|Avoiding a “No Deal” Scenario: Free Trade Agreements, Citizenship and Economic Rights|Whilst the legal and economic challenges presented by Brexit are gradually becoming more evident, observations and recommendations are already being drawn from consequences of a “ no deal scenario” and particularly the possibilities of entering into a variant of a Free Trade Agreement which should, prevent a “no deal” situation. Such a Free Trade Agreement existing between the current 28 EU Member States and the three EEA European Free Trade Association (EFTA) States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (EEA Internal Market) This paper, amongst other objectives, is aimed at highlighting such proposals which have been put forward to avert a “no deal scenario”. It is obvious that change – and more specifically, fundamental legislative, regulatory overhauls, will require not only the incorporation of expertise from different fields, but also time consuming and costly resources to address the demands of the transitional and implementation periods of such legislatively transformed landscapes. Certainly, a gradual process of incorporating and adapting to new regulatory and legislative changes and environments – and particularly in respect of economically sensitive related matters, would require not only thorough and dedicated observatory and monitoring periods, but also one which facilitates and encourages a process of greater democratic accountability and transparency to be incorporated into the legislative processes. Even though Brexit has generated a great degree of economic uncertainty – which has in turn presented challenges – as well as consequences, it also presents opportunities for new actors to engage and influence vital decision making aspects in areas which particularly revolve around information technology, sustainable development, innovation – as well hybrid financial instruments and volatile mediums which are embodied and personified by crypto currencies, derivatives and other complex financial instruments and mediums of exchange - all of which are reflective of a rapidly changing and evolving financial environment. The challenges now involve to a larger extent, the manner and the degree of relevance to which vital and dominating actors and institutions will be accurately represented and impact future legislation – particularly those which focus around issues relating to trade, environment and sustainable development policies.
G14|Closed House of Wonders museum: Implications to the tourism of Zanzibar Stone Town, UNESCO World Heritage Site|This paper examines the impact of the closed House of Wonders Museum in the tourism industry of Stone Town, Zanzibar. The paper aims to propose the best practices taken into account due to the impact raised by the closure of the Museum. There has been no clear information on the overall situation which faces the site since 2012 when the Museum closed. Data collected through mixed methods, including the sample size of 105 tourists who visited the House of Wonders Museum, 8 Government Official, 6 Tour Guides and 8 Tour Operators. The findings show that the closed museum has affected the level of tourists’ satisfaction, tour operators, community and tour guides economically. The paper recommends quick rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Museum to save the integrity and authenticity of this World Heritage Site.
G14|Pengaruh Kinerja Keuangan Terhadap Kualitas Informasi Internet Financial Reporting Dengan Kepemilikan Saham Publik Sebagai Variabel Moderasi<BR>[The Effect Of Financial Performance On Quality Of Internet Financial Reporting Information With Public Share Ownership As A Moderation Variable]|This study aims to test empirically whether public share ownership is able to moderate the relationship between the financial performance proxy with profitability on the quality of information. The quality of IFR information is measured through the disclosure index compiled by Boubaker et al (2012). This index contains 100 items of website-based disclosure that are commonly used in measuring the quality of accounting-based reporting information. The sample of this study is a manufacturing company listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, where the data analysis techniques that will be used are moderated Regression Analysis with the help of Indirect macro created by Andrew F. Hayes (2015) in combination with SPSS 23. The results show that public shareholding is able to moderate the relationship between financial performance with the quality of IFR information.
G14|Analisis Perbandingan Financial Distresspada Perusahaan Konstruksi Di Bursa Efek Indonesia Tahun 2014 –2018<BR>[Comparative Analysis Of Financial Distress In Construction Companies In Indonesia Stock Exchange In 2014 –2018]|This study aims to analyze the comparison of financial distress in construction companies in the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2014 -2018 using 5 methods are Altman Z-Score, Falmer, Grover, Springate and Zmijewski methods. The samplingtechnique used was purposive sampling. The sample in this study amounted to 8 construction companies. The analysis technique used is descriptive analysis by comparing the results of financial distress using the 5 methods. The results of the study stated that some companies experienced financial distress or experienced conditions of financial difficulties, such as Adhi Karya (ADHI) and Nusa Konstruksi Enjiniring (DGIK). Financial conditions that are unstable or experience fluctuations that cause companies to have the possibilityof financial distress
G14|Bagaimanapecking-Order Theory Menjelaskan Struktur Permodalan Bank Di Indonesia?<BR>[How Does The Pecking-Order Theory Explain The Bank'S Capital Structure In Indonesia?]|The pecking order theory of capital structure is one of the most influential theories of corporate finance. The purpose of this study is to explore the most important factors on a firm’s capital structure by pecking-order theory. Hierarchical regression is used as the analysis model. This study examines the determinants of debt decisions for 31Indonesianbanking companies that are quoted on the Indonesian Stock Exchange of 2010-2015. The results indicate that the determinants of capital structure are profitability and growth rate. The profitability negatively effects on the capital structure. It implies that firms prefer to use their earnings to finance business activities and thus useless debt capital. Growth rate positively affects capital structure. The greater growth opportunity will have more capital structure to finance the growth. Size is a moderator variable in this study. Size of firms moderates the effects of the tax rate on capital structure. Large firms appear to take advantage of the tax deductibility of debt. The findings are important for management and investors
G14|Stock Market Volatility Analysis using GARCH Family Models: Evidence from Zimbabwe Stock Exchange|Understanding the pattern of stock market volatility is important to investors as well as for investment policy. Volatility is directly associated with risks and returns, higher the volatility the more financial market is unstable. The volatility of the Zimbabwean stock market is modeled using monthly return series consisting of 109 observations from January 2010 to January 2019. ARCH effects test confirmed the use of GARCH family models. Symmetric and asymmetric models were used namely: GARCH(1,1), GARCH-M(1,1), IGARCH(1,1) and EGARCH(1,1). Post-estimation test for further ARCH effects were done for each model to confirm its efficiency for policy. EGARCH(1,1) turned to be the best model using both the AIC and SIC criterions; with the presence of asymmetry found to be significant. The study concludes that positive and negative shocks have different effects on the stock market returns series. Bad and good news will increase volatility of stock market returns in different magnitude. This simply imply that investors on the Zimbabwean stock exchange react differently to information depending be it positive or negative in making investment decisions.
G14|On the (in)efficiency of cryptocurrencies: Have they taken daily or weekly random walks?|The legitimacy of virtual currencies as an alternative form of monetary exchange has been the centre of an ongoing heated debated since the catastrophic global financial meltdown of 2007-2008. We contribute to the relative fresh body of empirical research on the informational market efficiency of cryptomarkets by investigating the weak-form efficiency of the top-five cryptocurrencies. In differing from previous studies, we implement random walk testing procedures which are robust to asymmetries and unobserved smooth structural breaks. Moreover, our study employs two frequencies of cryptocurrency returns, one corresponding to daily returns and the other to weekly returns. Our findings validate the random walk hypothesis for daily series hence validating the weak-form efficiency for daily returns. On the other hand, weekly returns are observed to be stationary processes which is evidence against weak-form efficiency for weekly returns. Overall, our study has important implications for market participants within cryptocurrency markets.
G14|The extended Friday the 13th Effect in the US stock returns|The classical Friday the 13th Effect refers to a calendar anomaly of financial markets which is generated by the fear of bad luck shared by the superstitious investors. As a result of their behavior, the returns from the supposed unlucky day of Friday the 13th are significant lower than those from the other Fridays. The superstition could also affect the returns from the trading days there are adjacent to Friday the 13th. In order to avoid the bad luck, some investors sell their stocks a trading day before and their transactions lead to a fall of the prices. Those who are reluctant to buy stocks on Friday the 13th delay such transactions to the next trading day causing prices to rise. In time, the knowledge about this pattern could induce significant changes in investors’ behavior, even to those that are not superstitious. Once become aware that one trading day before Friday the 13th the stock prices are usually low, many investors would prefer to sell two or three trading days before. There also were investors that would buy stocks not one trading day after Friday the 13th, when the prices are expected to be high, but two or three trading days after. Other investors could exploit the opportunities to buy cheap on Friday the 13th or one trading day before or to sell high one trading day after and their transactions could attenuate the abnormal returns from these days. In such ways the classical form of Friday the 13th Effect could be replaced by an extended form which consists in abnormal returns for a specific time interval that starts some trading days before the supposed unlucky day and ends some trading days after. This paper explores the behavior of the stock returns of 42 companies, from seven sectors of the United States economy, in the period January 2010 – March 2019, for a time interval that starts three trading days before Friday the 13th and ends three trading days after. The results indicate, for many of them, significant low returns in some trading days before Friday the 13th and/or significant high returns some trading days after. We also found some particularities of the extended Friday the 13th Effect among the seven sectors.
G14|Market concentration and bank M&As: Evidence from the European sovereign debt crisis|Using a sample of 312 bank M&As announced between 1998 and 2016 in the EU-27 countries, this paper investigates the impact of market concentration and the European sovereign debt crisis on the way investors react to these corporate events. In Western European countries, we find results which contrast the conventional wisdom that acquiring banks lose around the merger announcement date. In fact, since 2009, acquiring banks shareholders gain approximately $34 million around the announcement, a $56 million improvement compared to the pre-crisis period. These documented shareholder gains are also accompanied by significant improvements in post-merger profitability. Markedly, we link this superior performance of the post-2008 acquirers with the degree of market concentration in the Western European region. Finally, results for the Eastern European countries indicate that the crisis did not have a significant impact on the quality of bank M&As in the region.
G14|Dynamic Impact of the U.S. Monetary Policy on Oil Market Returns and Volatility|In this paper, we assess the dynamic impact of the U.S. monetary policy announcements on oil market futures returns and volatility. We use intra-day data together with a time-varying modeling approach to study the nature of this dynamic impact. In addition, we also control for macroeconomic news shocks and separately study the response of good and bad realized volatility. Evidence suggests that there is a significant time variation in the response of oil returns as well as its volatility to the Federal Reserve policy announcements. Furthermore, we find that higher (lower) uncertainty about Federal Reserve policy actions weakens (strengthens) the impact of the announcements on oil returns and volatility.
G14|125 Years of Time-Varying Effects of Fiscal Policy on Financial Markets|This paper examines the effect of fiscal policy on financial markets over a long span of 125 years. Unlike existing studies that mainly focus on monetary policy shocks and model-based identification of fiscal policy shocks, we use a time-varying model to study the effect of fiscal policy with much cleaner and direct identification of fiscal policy shocks. In addition, we extend our analysis by measuring the response volatility in these markets and separately study the effects of good and bad components of volatility. We find significant time-variation in the response of stock and bond market returns and volatility. The overall response of the stock market exceeds that of bond markets, with more pronounced effects in the pre-1950 period than in the last six decades. Fiscal consolidation generates long-term benefits that positively affect financial markets in the latter part of the 20th century, thus providing new insights into the dynamic role of fiscal policy.
G14|ECB, BoE and Fed Monetary-Policy announcements: price and volume effects on European securities markets|As a response to the recent global financial crisis, the main central banks implemented several programs of unconventional monetary policies. This paper assesses the announcement effects of the policy measures taken by the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve on European securities markets. We measure the impact of these announcements on government bond and stock prices and trading volumes. Using the event study methodology, we evaluate the reaction of some of the major European market indices around the announcement dates of unconventional monetary policies, over the period between 2008 and 2016. Our results show that the overall impact of the announcements of unconventional monetary policy measures is significant for European stock markets. Further, results suggest that the impact was more significant with the announcement of “Forward Guidance” and “Asset Purchases” policy measures, respectively, on stock prices and trading volumes. If events are categorized using a narrow definition of “Forward Guidance”, the effects for this category are positive but not always statistically significant.
G14|Do Multiple Credit Ratings Reduce Money Left on the Table? Evidence from US. IPOs| We examine initial public offerings (IPOs) with single, multiple, and no credit ratings. We document a beneficial effect of credit ratings on IPO underpricing, which is amplified by the existence of multiple credit ratings. Multiple ratings also reduce the extent of filing price revisions. Credit rating levels matter for IPOs with more than one rating but not for those with a single rating. Firms with multiple credit ratings also have higher probabilities of survival than those with a single or no rating. Finally, IPOs awarded a first credit rating between BB and BBB are more likely to seek an additional rating.
G14|Information, prices and efficiency in an online betting market|We study the odds (or prices) set by fifty-one online bookmakers for the result outcomes in over 16,000 association football matches in England since 2010. Adapting a methodology typically used to evaluate forecast efficiency, we test the Efficient Market Hypothesis in this context. We find odds are generally not biased when compared against actual match outcomes, both in terms of favourite-longshot or outcome types. But individual bookmakers are not efficient. Their own odds do not appear to use fully the information contained in their competitors' odds.
G14|An Information-Based Theory of Financial Intermediation|We advance a theory of how private information and heterogeneous screening ability across market participants shapes trade in decentralized asset markets. We solve for the equilibrium market structure and show that the investors who intermediate trade the most and interact with the largest set of counterparties must have the highest screening ability. That is, the primary intermediaries are those with superior information–screening experts. We provide empirical support for the model’s predictions using transaction-level micro data and information disclosure requirements. Finally, we study the connection between screening ability and efficiency, and observe that a market where all investors are screening experts–and thus, a market with no private information–may be dominated in terms of welfare by a market with no screening experts.
G14|Testing for information asymmetry in the mortgage servicing market|Our main objective is to test for evidence of information asymmetry in the mortgage servicing market. Does the sale of mortgage servicing rights (MSR) by the initial lender to a second servicing institution unveil any residual asymmetric information? We analyze the originator’s selling choice of MSR using a large sample of U.S. mortgages that were privately securitized during the period of January 2000 to December 2013 (more than 5 million observations). Our econometric methodology is mainly non-parametric and the main test for the presence of information asymmetry is driven by kernel density estimation techniques (Su and Spindler, 2013). We also employ the non-parametric testing procedure of Chiappori and Salanié (2000). For robustness, we present parametric tests to corroborate our results after controlling for observable risk characteristics, for econometric misspecification error, and for endogeneity issues using instrumental variables. Our empirical results provide strong support for the presence of second-stage asymmetric information in the mortgage servicing market.
G14|Stock Price Anchoring|"We provide evidence on a new anomaly in the stock market. We show that stock prices are very robustly correlated to firm value in a cross-sectional framework. We interpret this result as evidence that investors' valuations are biased by a specific version of the availability heuristic, by which investors wrongly interpret the easily available infor- mation about the stock price as a piece of relevant cross-sectional information about true firm value. In this way firm value is \anchored"" to the stock price, confirming the existence of anchoring effects in financial markets beyond the boundaries of the experimental lab. Interestingly, firms with a high nominal share price at the end of the year, tend to have lower returns in the subsequent year. After controlling for common risk factors, this underperformance amounts to 1.77 basis points per day, or 4.56% per annum."
G14|Flights to Safety|Despite a large and growing theoretical literature on flights to safety, there does not appear to exist an empirical characterization of flight-to-safety (FTS) episodes. Using only data on bond and stock returns, we identify and characterize flight to safety episodes for 23 countries. On average, FTS episodes comprise less than 5% of the sample, and bond returns exceed equity returns 2 to 3%. The majority of FTS events are country-specific not global. FTS episodes coincide with increases in the VIX, decreases in consumer sentiment indicators in the US, Germany and the OECD and appreciations of the yen and the Swiss franc. The financial, basic materials and industrial industries under-perform in FTS episodes, but the telecom industry outperforms. Both money market instruments and corporate bonds face abnormal negative returns in FTS episodes. Most commodity prices decrease sharply during FTS episodes, whereas the gold price measured in dollars increases slightly. Both economic growth and inflation decline right after and up to a year following a FTS spell.
G14|Presidential Power and Stock Returns|Recent studies highlight positive effect of political connections on firm performance and stock returns. This paper shows that the positive effect of political connections on the cross-sectional stock returns disappears in the weak presidency period, defined as the last two years before the presidential party change, or period of low job approval ratings. The extent of the presidential party?s control over the Congress does not affect our main result. The result is driven by small firms, who typically do not have financial resources to hedge away political risks, and by the firms located in the states where residents more strongly support the president. Additional test suggests that the industries that rely on heavy government expenditure use a variety of political strategies to maintain the value of their political capital even during the weak presidency period.
G14|The U.S. term structure and stock market volatility: Evidence from emerging stock markets|Decomposing the term structure of U.S. treasury yields into two components, the expectations factor and the maturity premium, we examine whether the U.S. term structure contains predictive information over emerging stock market volatility. Based on data from 20 emerging markets, we provide positive evidence that holds even after controlling for country specific factors including turnover and market size. Our findings indicate the market?s expectation of future short term rates, implied by the expectations factor, serves as a stronger predictor of stock market volatility compared to the maturity premium component of the yield spread. Moreover, the predictive power of the U.S. term structure increases following the global financial crisis.
G14|Ownership structure, political uncertainty and bank stock prices informativeness|This paper examines the relation between ownership structure and bank stock price informativeness across 59 countries over the period 2002?2014. We also evaluate how political uncertainty affects the impact of bank ownership on informative stock prices. Using a regression?s R-squared value of individual stock returns on market and industry indexes to gauge bank informative stock prices, we find evidence that more state-owned banks located in developing countries tend to have higher synchronous, i.e., lower informative, stock prices than their domestic private-owned and foreign-owned banks. The paper finds no strong correlation between ownership and stock price informativeness for banks located in developed countries. With respect to the impact of politics, we find that in developing countries political uncertainty dampens bank informative stock prices during election years, whereas in developed countries elections do not affect the stock price informativeness. Next, in order to test whether the differential in informative stock prices between state-owned banks and non-state banks is driven by political uncertainty, the paper checks whether this differential widens during election years; it finds strong support for this conjecture. The impact of elections on the relation between bank ownership and stock price informativeness also varies with different legal origins and political systems. These findings suggest that the political channel plays an important role in determining the expropriation behavior of government controlling shareholders, especially in developing countries.
G14|An Anomaly in Hong Kong Stock Market|The Eastern market wisdom of ?May is poor, June is bleak, and July will turn around? unveils an international stock markets dynamic that lower returns in May followed by even worse return in June but rebounding back to an upward trend in July. This wisdom is termed as ?Eastern Halloween? effect in this paper which has some similarities with the traditional Halloween Effect but differing in duration and timing. This paper examines the Eastern Halloween effect on Hong Kong stock market and the results show that May and June period returns are superior than the returns on the rest of the calendar months in Hong Kong Stock Market.
G14|Asset Liquidity in Monetary Theory and Finance: A Unified Approach|Economists often say that certain types of assets, e.g., Treasury bonds, are very â€˜liquidâ€™. Do they mean that these assets are likely to serve as media of exchange or collateral (a definition ofliquidityoftenemployedinmonetarytheory), orthattheycanbeeasilysoldinasecondary market, if needed (a definition of liquidity closer to the one adopted in finance)? We develop a model where these two notions of asset liquidity coexist, and their relative importance is determined endogenously in general equilibrium: how likely agents are to visit a secondary market in order to sell assets for money depends on whether sellers of goods/services accept these assets as means of payment. But, also, the incentive of sellers to invest in a technology that allows them to recognize and accept assets as means of payment depends on the exis- tence (and efficiency) of a secondary market where buyers could liquidate assets for cash. The interaction between these two channels offers new insights regarding the determination of asset prices and the ability of assets to facilitate transactions and improve welfare.
G14|Positive Stock Information In Out-Of-The-Money Option Prices| We examine whether the option market leads the stock market with respect to positive in addition to negative price discovery. We document that out-of-themoney (OTM) option prices, which determine the Risk-Neutral Skewness (RNS) of the underlying stock return’s distribution, can embed positive information regarding the underlying stock. A long-only portfolio of stocks with the highest RNS values yields significant positive alpha in the post-ranking week during the period 1996-2014. This outperformance is mainly driven by stocks that are relatively underpriced but are also exposed to greater downside risk. These findings are consistent with a trading mechanism where investors choose to exploit perceived stock underpricing via OTM options due to their embedded leverage, rather than directly buying the underlying stock to avoid exposure to its potential downside. Due to the absence of severe limits-to-arbitrage for the long-side, the price correction signalled by RNS is very quick, typically overnight.
G14|How much information is incorporated in financial asset prices? Experimental Evidence|We propose a new estimation method and use experimental data from multiple double auction experiments in the literature to directly estimate how much information is incorporated in financial market prices. We find that public information is almost completely reflected in prices, but that surprisingly little private information—less than 50%—is incorporated in prices. Our estimates therefore suggest that while semi-strong informational efficiency is consistent with the data, financial market prices may be very far from strong-form efficiency. We compare our estimates with beliefs of economists surveyed at the Econometric Society Meetings, and find that economists and finance researchers alike expect market prices to reflect considerably more private information than what we estimated.
G14|Prediction Markets and Poll Releases: When Are Prices Most Informative?|Prediction markets are a popular platform for eliciting incentivised crowd predictions. In this paper, we examine variation in the information contained in prediction market prices by studying Intrade prices on U.S. elections around the release of opinion polls. We find that poll releases stimulate an immediate uptick in trading activity. However, much of this activity involves relatively inexperienced traders and, as a result, price efficiency declines in the immediate aftermath of a poll release. It is not until more experienced traders enter the market in the following ours that price efficiency recovers. More generally, this suggests that information releases do not necessarily improve prediction market forecasts, but may instead attract noise traders who temporarily reduce price efficiency.
G14|The Tail That Keeps the Riskless Rate Low|Riskless interest rates fell in the wake of the financial crisis and have remained low. We explore a simple explanation: this recession was perceived as an extremely unlikely event before 2007. Observing such an episode led all agents to reassess macro risk, in particular the probability of tail events. Since changes in beliefs endure long after the event itself has passed, perceived “tail risk” remains high, generates a demand for riskless liquid assets, and continues to depress the riskless rate. We embed this mechanism into a simple production economy with liquidity constraints and use observable macro data, along with standard econometric tools, to discipline beliefs about the distribution of aggregate shocks. When agents observe an extreme adverse realization, they reestimate the distribution and attach a higher probability to such an event recurring. As a result, even transitory shocks have persistent effects because once observed, the shocks stay forever in the agents’ data set. We show that our belief revision mechanism can help explain the persistent nature of the fall in risk-free rates.

G14|The Federal Reserve and market confidence|We discover a novel monetary policy shock that has a widespread impact on aggregate financial conditions and market confidence. Our shock can be summarized by the response of long-horizon yields to Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcements; not only is it orthogonal to changes in the near-term path of policy rates, but it also explains more than half of the abnormal variation in the yield curve on announcement days. We find that our shock is positively related to changes in real interest rates and market volatility, and negatively related to market returns and mortgage issuance, consistent with policy announcements affecting market confidence. Our results demonstrate that Federal Reserve pronouncements influence markets independent of changes in the stance of conventional monetary policy.
G14|An Auction-Based Test of Private Information in an Interdealer FX Market|There are several financial markets where a few dealers trade a large share of total volume, while also having access to periodic auctions of the same asset conducted by a third party. For such a market, we derive a test of private information about the value of the asset that combines data on both bidding behavior and market trades. Our approach is to test for private versus common values, as defined in auction theory. We use changes in trading prices of extreme bidders before and after the auction to test the null hypothesis of private values (no private information) against the alternative of common values (private information). Additionally, we use a regression discontinuity design where we compare the behavior of dealers bidding right below and right above the auction's cutoff price to control for inventory effects. Our case study are foreign exchange auctions conducted by the Central Bank of Colombia during the period 2008-2014, and the corresponding interdealer market for Colombian Pesos against US dollars. Overall, our test rejects the null hypothesis. Specifically, information revealed to the bidders about their relative valuations has a subsequent effect on trading prices, at an hourly trading window, equivalent to 23% - 39% of the standard deviation of currency prices. **** RESUMEN: Existen varios mercados financieros en los que algunos intermediarios tranzan una gran parte del volumen total, además de tener acceso a subastas periódicas del mismo activo realizadas por un tercero. Para dicho mercado, derivamos una prueba de información privada sobre el valor del activo que combina datos sobre el comportamiento de las pujas y las transacciones de mercado. Nuestro enfoque es probar valores privados versus valores comunes, tal como se define en la teoría de subastas. Utilizamos cambios en los precios de mercado de los postores extremos antes y después de la subasta para probar la hipótesis nula de valores privados (sin información privada) frente a la alternativa de valores comunes (información privada). Además, utilizamos un diseño de regresión discontinua en el que comparamos el comportamiento de los postores que ofertan justo debajo y encima del precio de corte de la subasta para controlar por posibles efectos de inventario. Nuestro caso de estudio son las subastas de divisas realizadas por el Banco de la República de Colombia durante el periodo 2008-2014, y el mercado cambiario correspondiente de pesos-dólar. En general, nuestra prueba rechaza la hipótesis nula. En particular, la información revelada a los postores sobre sus valoraciones relativas tiene un efecto sobre los precios de mercado, en una ventana de una hora, equivalente al 23% - 39% de la desviación estándar de los precios de las divisas.
G14|Here Lives a Wealthy Man: Price Rigidity and Predictability in Luxury Housing Markets|We use novel and unique data to study the effect of price changes in the market for luxury and middle class homes. We find that luxury home sales respond less to price changes than the middle-class home sales; in the market for luxury homes, past prices affect current prices; luxury home prices persist; and prices of luxury homes are stickier than prices of middle-class homes. Recent macroeconomic models predict that housing markets can have counter-cyclical effect, if home prices are flexible. Our findings imply that home prices, especially luxury home prices, may not be flexible enough to generate such effect.
G14|Asymmetric Information, Predictability and Momentum in the Corporate Bond Market|We show that firm-level cross-asset predictability for bonds with a high incidence of informed trading is mostly driven by information diffusion. In contrast, the activities of uninformed investors dominate in originating predictability for the remaining bonds in the firm-level cross-section. Capitalizing on these results, we explore the role of informed and uninformed trading in determining the momentum effect. We find that gradual information diffusion is the main driver of short-term momentum. However, the effect of uninformed trading may outweigh that of information in generating large momentum returns, as it is the case for private-issuer bonds.
G14|The impact of central clearing on the market for single-name credit default swaps|In this paper, we examine the impact of the voluntary central clearing scheme on the CDS market for North American firms during the period spanning 2009 to 2015. In order to address the endogeneity problem arising from the fact that central clearing is not mandatory for single-name CDSs, we use a methodology that relies on propensity-score matching combined with generalized difference-in-differences. Our empirical findings show that initiating the central clearing results in an increase in CDS spreads, while there is no evidence of an associated improvement in CDS market liquidity and trading activity or of a deterioration in the default risk of the underlying bond. These results suggest that the increase in CDS spreads of centrally cleared entities can be mainly attributed to the reduction in CDS counterparty risk, and that the magnitude of this price increase (19 bps) could be used as an assessment of counterparty risk in the non-cleared CDS market.
G14|The growing impact of US monetary policy on emerging financial markets: Evidence from India|Much research has been devoted to studying the international spillover effects of US monetary policy. However, a lot of the focus has been on the recent unconventional monetary policies undertaken by the Federal Reserve. Combining high frequency financial market data with a time-varying parameter approach we show that US monetary policy decisions have had significant effects on the Indian stock markets well before the use of unconventional policy tools and that these effects have gotten stronger over time. In addition to the conventional channel of surprise changes in the policy rate, we find that US monetary shocks are also transmitted through an uncertainty channel, which is especially important for announcements about large scale asset purchases (quantitative easing). Using firm level stock prices, we also show that the higher sensitivity of the aggregate response is uniform across the stock market and is not driven by the increased exposure of any specific industry to US monetary policy. Instead, our results suggest that it is driven by the portfolio decisions of foreign institutional investors and the exchange rate becoming more sensitive to US monetary policy.
G14|New More Powerful Likelihood Ratio Tests for Short Horizon Event Studies|"Short horizon Event Studies (ES) in financial research, are concerned with the effects of firm-specific or market-wide events such as, stock-splits, earnings announcements, mergers and acquisitions, derivatives introductions etc. on the underlying firms' stock prices. Though it has been around for half a century, and evidences abound about the phenomenon of Event Induced Variance (EIV), the methodological development in the ES literature, has mostly focused only on a shift in location of the expected abnormal returns.In this work, a random-effect model is proposed which explicitly accounts for the (empirically observed) cross-sectional variance of the (predicted) abnormal returns, along with another parameter accommodating for (another empirical phenomenon of) a change in post-event volatility. Under this model, the null hypothesis of ""no event effect"" also involves these additional variance parameters other than the usual mean. This necessitates development of new tests for this and other hypotheses of interests in ES, for which new Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRTs) are derived.As is standard in the ES literature, the specification and power behavior of the newly developed LRTs are compared with those of the existing ES tests, using real returns of 1231 stocks, that were listed in the National Stock Exchange, India between April 1998 and January 2016. 100,000 samples of sizes 5 and 50 are drawn to estimate and compare the probabilities of type-I error and power of the tests. The new LRTs are compared with both the popular and recent parametric and non-parametric ES tests in the literature. The powers are compared under both presence and absence of shift in location of the distribution of the abnormal returns, along with those of the two components of EIV. The newly developed LRTs are found to be adequately specified, and for more powerful than the existing ES tests in the literature, for a wide spectrum of alternatives."
G14|Study on the Co-movement between Stock Markets in Asia, Europe and the North America|This study examined impacts of two--the US and Greek--crises of differing causes and scales on stock markets. The US crisis (or the Great Recession) broke out in 2008 in a developed economy due to sub-prime mortgage loans in a private sector. The Greek crisis was triggered by mounting sovereign debts in the public sector (government) in a developing economy. This study used the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model to analyze volatility spillovers and co-movements among 11 stock markets in Asia, Europe, and the North America. Some of notable findings are: 1) Stock markets in these regions had not been fully integrated; 2) the US market became more integrated with stock markets in Europe but less with those markets in Asia and Greece after the two crises; 3) after the US crisis, the US market had been dominant in European markets but not in Asian markets; 4) decreasing intra-continental correlations support that stock markets in Asia and Europe had been less integrated; 5) decreasing inter-continental correlations support that the markets in Asia and Europe became less integrated in the post-crisis period; 6) increasing inter-continental correlations between the US and Asian markets and between the US and European markets support more integration; 7) after the US crisis, European markets adjusted faster to innovations (shocks) by the US crisis but Asian markets adjustment slowed; 8) the significance of ARCH terms supports strong financial contagion from the US market to other financial markets; 9) significant GARCH terms support strong volatility spillovers from the US and Greek markets to other markets; and 10) the (developed) US market had much more significant impacts on other markets than did the developing Greek market. In sum, the overall results suggest that stock markets in these regions had not been fully integrated, and there still exist potential diversification benefits to be exploited by investors.
G14|Does cross-listing mitigate sub-optimal corporate investment?|This paper examines whether managers of cross-listed firms improve corporate investment efficiency through learning from the stock market upon cross-listing. Using a sample of UK firms cross-listed on US regulated and unregulated stock markets, we find that cross-listed firms on unregulated markets invest more efficiently than non-cross-listed firms following cross-listing. The analysis of pre- and post-cross-listing shows that cross-listed firms improve their investment efficiency post cross-listing regardless of the location of cross-listing (i.e. regulated versus unregulated exchanges). Furthermore, we find firms with low level of private information embedded in their stock prices, and firms with higher board independence improve their investment post cross-listing. Our findings suggest that managers of cross-listed firms are guided by firm-specific characteristic more than by stock market signals when they embark on new investment projects. Moreover, we find evidence that cross-listed firms on regulated exchanges perform poorly after cross-listing, whereas those cross-listed on unregulated exchange experience high performance post cross-listing. This indicates that the listing and regulatory requirements imposed on cross-listed firms by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) do not effectively deter managers from investing in value-destroying projects.
G14|Measuring herding behavior in the Russian stock market|This paper attempts to examine herding behavior in the Russian stock market by implementing four different methods designed to test for herding by Chang et al. (2000), Christie&Huang (1995), Hwang&Salmon (2001) and Torrecillas et al (2016). The main goal is to investigate the implications of the interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations for the stock market efficiency. The results of the work help to identify the sources of herding behavior in the Russian stock market.Employing different approaches towards measuring herding, it is possible to determine whether individuals copy each other?s actions (Torrecillas et al (2016)) or herd towards market views about market index (Chang et al. (2000), Christie&Huang (1995), Hwang&Salmon (2001)). This paper starts by the establishing the transition from efficient-market behavior to herding behavior by using Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (Torrecillas et al (2016)) applied to MICEX closing prices within the period from September 1997 to December 2017. The DFA reveals the presence of persistent herding behavior during the 2007-2009 crisis. Next, Christie and Huang?s CSSD measure of stock returns is used to capture if herding related to the firm-specific risk in the portfolio is present at the market. Consistent with results of the previous studies, the method fails to establish traces of herding. Christie and Huang?s improved measure of CSSD with non-linear trend by Chang et al. (2000) yields evidence of herding in the down market during monetary policy announcements. The results of the Hwang and Salmon?s state space models help to demonstrate herding related to the market risk by analyzing relative dispersion of the time-varying betas for assets. The main finding is that changes in the betas can?t be explained by movements in fundamentals, which indicates intentional herding. Therefore, bad news for the stock market (interest rate increase and currency depreciation) induce intentional herding in the Russian stock market. Intentional herding during market stress has important implications for portfolio diversification for both diversified and undiversified investors.
G14|Effects of Sovereign Credit Rate Announcements on Turkey Stock Exchange Market|International Credit Rating Agencies take an important place in economic, financial and commercial situation of countries. These agencies examine economic and political environment of countries, evaluate creditworthiness assessment factors and assign sovereign credit rate for each country. Leading credit rating agencies are Standard & Poor?s, Moody?s and Fitch, which are called as ?Big Three?. Their ratings play a router role in international investments. In addition, credit rate announcements may influence financial markets. In this study, effects of Turkey?s sovereign credit ratings, given by Big Three, on the main stock exchange index (BIST100) will be examined. Within this framework, event study methodology will be used to analyse the impacts of announcements. The aim of the study is to research effects of sovereign credit rate announcements on stock exchange markets.
G14|Mis-pricing in Single Stock Futures: Evidence from National Stock Exchange of India|We examine the determinants of mispricing in single stock futures traded in the National Stock Exchange of India, the second largest global trading venue for such contracts. We compute mispricing bounds using multi-regime models for over one hundred stocks. The size of the mispricing window - defined as the distance between these bounds - increases with decrease in liquidity. Liquidity of the futures market has a larger impact on the size of the mispricing window as compared to that of the spot market. After controlling for such liquidity effects, the size of the mispricing window is found to increase with increase in volatility. This suggests that concerns related to margin calls and execution shortfalls dominate early exit options. Volatility has an asymmetrical effect on mispricing bounds. We attribute this to short-sale constraints since they make the early exit option difficult to exercise when futures are under-priced.
G14|Implications of Extreme Value Theory for stock market investments|Young post-communist Eastern European equity are more vulnerable to external and internal shocks than more mature, developed markets. Also, previous studies have attested that generally the distribution of stock prices exhibits deviations from Gaussianity, including the so-called ?heavy tails?. The higher degree of volatility encountered on these markets leads to the expectation that heavy-tailedness properties for stock returns will be more pronounced. In this research we attempt to confirm the fat/heavy tails hypothesis for a selection of 98 stocks listed on the Romanian Stock Market and we manage to accomplish this in a fairly large number of cases, both for the left and the right side of the distribution of daily logarithmic returns. Next, we try to establish whether ?booms? are more likely than ?crashes? for each company in the sample. Robustness checks via bootstraping enable the rejection or acceptance of this hypothesis with 95% confidence. The empirical results have important implications both for practioners via portfolio investment decisions and also for academic research i.e. value-at-risk or asset alocation models.
G14|Does Herd Behaviour Exist In Turkish Stock Markets? The Case Of Borsa Istanbul|Herd describes how individuals in a group can act collectively without centralized direction. The herd behavior on stock markets implies that investors ignore their own ideas in stock trading decisions and trade in the direction of the market. It is important to detect the effect of herding behavior in markets to assess the validity of rational asset pricing models and diversification opportunities. This paper, the validity of herding has been researched at Borsa Istanbul by considering two different models developed by Christie and Huang (1995) and Chang, Cheng, and Khorana (2000). Research data consists of daily logarithmic stock returns for the period of 1998 ? 2016. Study has been diversified by dividing the period into two sub-periods, 1998-2005 and 2006- 2016. According to obtained results, the direction that herding behavior effect has been felt intensively at the first sub-period in rising market conditions. The effect has fallen at the second sub-period.
G14|Mean Reversion and Momentum in Central and Eastern European Countries ? A Case Study on Poland and Romania|There is considerable evidence that both mean reversion and momentum exist in stock prices, especially in well developed countries. We analyze these phenomena for two Central and Eastern European countries that experienced very different transitions from centrally-planned to market economies: Poland and Romania. While being considered an emerging market, Poland?s stock market capitalization increased from 3 percent of GDP in 1995 to about 30 percent in 2017. Romania?s stock market capitalization in the 1990s and early 2000s was less than 6 percent of GDP and only recently increased to about 21 percent. We examine how mean reversion and momentum have affected stock prices in these two very different emerging economies and we find very similar results. For both, the speed at which stocks converge back to their fundamentals (i.e., mean reversion) is much faster than that of the developed markets, with half-lives only slightly greater than 9 months. These results are similar to the ones obtained for the Chinese market (see Wu, 2011), but much shorter than the 3-4 years found for the well-developed economies. We also find that, similarly to the Chinese market, the momentum effect is weak. As a result, in most cases, a strategy combining mean reversion and momentum generates abnormal excess returns only for holding periods of less than 12 months.
G14|The Relationship Between Footballer and Head Coach Transfer News and Stock Prices of Sport Clubs|Sportive performances of sports clubs are closely pursued by investors and the effect of match results on stock prices are widely investigated in the literature. On the other hand, whatever the results of the matches might be, the football players and head coaches affect the game by their physical performances, abilities, intelligence and strategic thinking characteristics. Football players and head coaches are the most important assets of the clubs that they work for. Nevertheless, the impact of transfer news of football players and head coaches on the clubs' stock prices have rarely been studied. We aimed to analyze the effects of transfer news of Trabzonspor (TSPOR: Istanbul), one of the four sports clubs traded in Borsa Istanbul, on stock prices within the scope of this study. The transfers exceeding a capital of 1 million Euros during the period of 2013-2017 were investigated by event study analysis. By analyzing 47 events related to football players and 15 events to head coaches, it was found that the contract news of head coaches had more prominent effects on returns than that of footballers'.
G14|The application of Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall as Controlling Mechanism of Systematic Risk of Pakistani Stock Market|Fama and French (1992) three factor and Fama and French (2014) five-factor Model estimated relevant idiosyncratic factors and CAPM beta as the systematic risk factor for stock returns? variations. Application of Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) modified the risk management criteria. This study applies traditional one factor, three factor and five factor model on Pakistan?s manufacturing companies. Compares and modifies the stated models while using VaR and ES as systematic risk factor and check the robustness of the significant extent of worst expected loss provided by VaR and ES by measuring 95% and 99% confidence levels and their impact on the stock returns. In comparison with traditional market risk factor, our findings are in favor of VaR and ES factor as it significantly affects the cross-sectional of excess stock returns and fulfills the criteria of risk aversion.
G14|Social Transmission Bias and Investor Behavior|We offer a new social approach to investment decision making and asset prices. Investors discuss their strategies and convert others to their strategies with a probability that increases in investment returns. The conversion rate is shown to be convex in realized returns. Unconditionally, active strategies (e.g., high variance and skewness) dominate, although investors have no inherent preference over these characteristics. The model has strong predictions for how adoption of active strategies depends on investors' social networks. In contrast with nonsocial approaches, sociability, self-enhancing transmission and other features of the communication process determine the popularity and pricing of active investment strategies.
G14|Do Proxies for Informed Trading Measure Informed Trading? Evidence from Illegal Insider Trades|This paper exploits hand-collected data on illegal insider trades to test whether standard illiquidity measures can detect informed trading. Controlling for unobserved cross-sectional and time-series variation, sampling bias, and strategic timing of insider trades, I find that only absolute order imbalance and the negative autocorrelation of order flows are statistically and economically robust predictors of insider trading. However, this result only holds for short-lived information. When information is long-lived, none of the measures of illiquidity I consider detect informed trading, including bid-ask spreads, Kyle's lambda, and Amihud illiquidity. These results suggest that standard measures of illiquidity have limited applications.
G14|What Is the Impact of Successful Cyberattacks on Target Firms?|We examine which firms are targets of successful cyberattacks and how they are affected. We find that cyberattacks are more likely to occur at larger and more visible firms, more highly valued firms, firms with more intangible assets, and firms with less board attention to risk management. These attacks affect firms adversely when consumer financial information is appropriated, but seem to have little impact otherwise. Attacks where consumer financial information is appropriated are associated with a significant negative stock market reaction, an increase in leverage following greater debt issuance, a deterioration in credit ratings, and an increase in cash flow volatility. These attacks also affect sales growth adversely for large firms and firms in retail industries, and there is evidence that they decrease investment in the short run. Affected firms respond to such attacks by cutting the CEO's bonus as a fraction of total compensation, by reducing the risk-taking incentives of management, and by taking actions to strengthen their risk management. The evidence is consistent with cyberattacks increasing boards' assessment of target firm risk exposures and decreasing their risk appetite.
G14|How News and Its Context Drive Risk and Returns Around the World|We develop a classification methodology for the context and content of news articles to predict risk and return in stock markets in 51 developed and emerging economies. A parsimonious summary of news, including topic-specific sentiment, frequency, and unusualness (entropy) of word flow, predicts future country-level returns, volatilities, and drawdowns. Economic and statistical significance are high and larger for year-ahead than monthly predictions. The effect of news measures on market outcomes differs by country type and over time. News stories about emerging markets contain more incremental information. Out-of-sample testing confirms the economic value of our approach for forecasting country-level market outcomes.
G14|Sophisticated Investors and Market Efficiency: Evidence from a Natural Experiment|We study how sophisticated investors, when faced with changes in information environment, adjust their information acquisition and trading behavior, and how these changes in turn affect market efficiency. We find that, after exogenous reductions of analyst coverage due to closures of brokerage firms, hedge funds scale up information acquisition. They trade more aggressively and earn higher abnormal returns on the affected stocks. Moreover, the participation of hedge fund significantly mitigates the impairment of market efficiency caused by coverage reductions. Our results show a substitution effect between sophisticated investors and public information providers in facilitating market efficiency in a causal framework.
G14|Do Properly Anticipated Prices Fluctuate Randomly? Evidence from VIX Futures Markets|The VIX index is not traded on the spot market. Hence, in contrast to other futures markets, the VIX futures contract and spot index are not linked by a no-arbitrage condition. We examine (a) whether predictability in the VIX index carries over to the futures market, and (b) whether there is independent time series predictability in VIX futures prices. The answer to both questions is no. Samuelson (1965) was right: VIX futures prices properly anticipate predictability in volatility, and are themselves unpredictable.
G14|Market-making with Search and Information Frictions|We develop a dynamic model of trading through market-makers that incorporates two canonical sources of illiquidity: trading (or search) frictions, which imply that market-makers have some amount of market power; and information frictions, which imply that market-makers face some degree of adverse selection. We use this model to study the effects of various technological innovations and regulatory initiatives that have reduced trading frictions in over-the-counter markets. Our main result is that reducing trading frictions can lead to less liquidity, as measured by bid-ask spreads. The key insight is that more frequent trading—or more competition among dealers—makes traders’ behavior less dependent on asset quality. As a result, dealers learn about asset quality more slowly and set wider bid-ask spreads to compensate for this increase in uncertainty.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
G14|Mood Betas and Seasonalities in Stock Returns|Existing research has documented cross-sectional seasonality of stock returns—the periodic outperformance of certain stocks during the same calendar months or weekdays. A model in which assets differ in their sensitivities to investor mood explains these effects and implies other seasonal patterns. We find that relative performance across individual stocks or stock portfolios during past high or low mood months and weekdays tends to recur/reverse in periods with congruent/noncongruent mood. Furthermore, assets with higher sensitivities to aggregate mood—higher mood betas — subsequently earn higher/lower returns during high/low mood periods, including those induced by Daylight Saving Time changes, weather conditions and anticipation of major holidays.
G14|Q5|In a multiperiod investment framework, firms with high expected growth earn higher expected returns than firms with low expected growth, holding investment and expected profitability constant. This paper forms cross-sectional growth forecasts, and constructs an expected growth factor that yields an average premium of 0.82% per month (t = 9.81). The q5 model, which augments the Hou-Xue-Zhang (2015) q-factor model with the new factor, shows strong explanatory power in the cross section, and outperforms other recently proposed factor models such as the Fama-French (2018) 6-factor model.
G14|How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Fire Sales|In canonical models with financial constraints, the possibility of fire sales creates a pecuniary externality that results in ex-ante overinvestment. I show that this result is sensitive to the microfoundations for fire sales. If they result from asymmetric information instead of misallocation, the overinvestment result is reversed. Macroprudential policy may therefore need to treat different types of investment differently.
G14|Do Foreign Investors Improve Market Efficiency?|We study the impact of foreign institutional investors on global capital allocation and welfare using novel firm-level international data. Using MSCI index inclusion as an exogenous shock to foreign ownership, we show that greater foreign ownership leads to more informative stock prices and this effect arises more from increased price efficiency than from improved firm governance. We further show that the impact of capital flows on price efficiency is due to real efficiency gains, as opposed to better information disclosure. Finally, we show that foreign ownership increases market liquidity, reduces firms' cost of equity, and leads to subsequent growth in their real investments, thus improving overall welfare.
G14|IQ from IP: Simplifying Search in Portfolio Choice|Using a novel database that tracks web traffic on the SEC’s EDGAR server between 2004 and 2015, we show that institutional investors gather information on a very particular subset of firms and insiders, and their surveillance is very persistent over time. This tracking behavior has powerful implications for their portfolio choice, and its information content. An institution that downloaded an insider-trading filing by a given firm last quarter increases its likelihood of downloading an insider-trading filing on the same firm by more than 41.3% this quarter. Moreover, the average tracked stock that an institution buys generates annualized alphas of over 12% relative to the purchase of an average non-tracked stock. We find that institutional managers tend to track members of the top management teams of firms (CEOs, CFOs, Presidents, and Board Chairs), and tend to share educational and location-based commonalities with the specific insiders they choose to follow. Collectively, our results suggest that the information in tracked trades is important for fundamental firm value and is only revealed following the information-rich dual trading by insiders and linked institutions.
G14|Asset Insulators|We propose that financial institutions can act as asset insulators, holding assets for the long run to protect their valuations from consequences of exposure to financial markets. We illustrate the empirical relevance of this theory for the balance sheet behavior of a large class of intermediaries, life insurance companies. The pass-through from assets to equity is an especially informative metric for distinguishing the asset insulator theory from Modigliani-Miller or other standard models. We estimate the pass-through using security-level data on insurers' holdings matched to corporate bond returns. Uniquely consistent with the insulator view, outside of the 2008-2009 crisis insurers lose as little as 10 cents in response to a dollar drop in asset values, while during the crisis the pass-through rises to roughly 1. The rise in pass-through highlights the fragility of insulation exactly when it is most valuable.
G14|Missing Events in Event Studies: Identifying the Effects of Partially-Measured News Surprises|Macroeconomic news announcements are elaborate and multi-dimensional. We consider a framework in which jumps in asset prices around macroeconomic news and monetary policy announcements reflect both the response to observed surprises in headline numbers and latent factors, reflecting other details of the release. The details of the non-headline news, for which there are no expectations surveys, are unobservable to the econometrician, but nonetheless elicit a market response. We estimate the model by the Kalman filter, which essentially combines OLS- and heteroscedasticity-based event study estimators in one step, showing that those methods are better thought of as complements rather than substitutes. The inclusion of a single latent factor greatly improves our ability to explain asset price movements around announcements.
G14|Non-monetary news in central bank communication|Using evidence from four major central banks, we decompose news conveyed by central-bank communication into news about monetary policy (monetary news), as well as non-monetary news, i.e., news about economic growth and news affecting financial risk premia. Our approach exploits high-frequency comovement of stocks and interest rates combined with monotonicity restrictions across maturities in the yield curve. We find significant differences in the news composition depending on the communication channel used by central banks. Monetary news prevails in policy decision announcements. However, the non-monetary component accounts for more than half of communications that provide context to policy decisions such as press conferences and minutes. We show that non-monetary news drives a significant part of financial markets' reaction during the financial crisis and in the early recovery, while monetary news gains importance since 2013.
G14|Non-Monetary News in Central Bank Communication|We quantify the importance of non-monetary news in central bank communication. Using evidence from four major central banks and a comprehensive classification of events, we decompose news conveyed by central banks into news about monetary policy, economic growth, and separately, shocks to risk premia. Our approach exploits high-frequency comovement of stocks and interest rates combined with monotonicity restrictions across the yield curve. We find significant differences in news composition depending on the communication channel used by central banks. Non-monetary news prevails in about 40% of policy decision announcements by the Fed and the ECB, and this fraction is even higher for communications that provide context to policy decisions such as press conferences. We show that non-monetary news accounts for a significant part of financial markets' reaction during the financial crisis and in the early recovery, while monetary shocks gain importance since 2013.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
G14|Debt, Information, and Illiquidity|"We analyze the empirical determinants of liquidity in debt markets in light of predictions stemming from debt-based information theories. We conduct a battery of tests confirming predictions of asymmetric information models of bond liquidity, including those that predict a``hockey-stick"" relation between bond liquidity and underlying fundamental value. When debt is deep in the money, it becomes informationally insensitive and more liquid. In contrast, when firm value deteriorates towards the left tail, the value of debt becomes informationally sensitive and less liquid. We alleviate endogeneity concerns using exogenous variation in firm value that is plausibly not driven by bond liquidity. Our results shed new empirical light on the determination of liquidity in debt markets."
G14|Lazy Prices|Using the complete history of regular quarterly and annual filings by U.S. corporations from 1995-2014, we show that when firms make an active change in their reporting practices, this conveys an important signal about future firm operations. Changes to the language and construction of financial reports also have strong implications for firms’ future returns: a portfolio that shorts “changers” and buys “non-changers” earns up to 188 basis points in monthly alphas (over 22% per year) in the future. Changes in language referring to the executive (CEO and CFO) team, regarding litigation, or in the risk factor section of the documents are especially informative for future returns. We show that changes to the 10-Ks predict future earnings, profitability, future news announcements, and even future firm-level bankruptcies; meanwhile firms that do not make changes experience positive abnormal returns. Unlike typical underreaction patterns in asset prices, we find no announcement effect associated with these changes–with returns only accruing when the information is later revealed through news, events, or earnings–suggesting that investors are inattentive to these simple changes across the universe of public firms.
G14|Shared Analyst Coverage: Unifying Momentum Spillover Effects|Identifying stock connections by shared analyst coverage, we find that a connected-stock (CS) momentum factor generates a monthly alpha of 1.68% (t = 9.67). In spanning regressions, the alphas of industry, geographic, customer, customer/supplier industry, single- to multi-segment, and technology momentum factors are insignificant/negative after controlling for CS momentum. Similar results hold in cross-sectional regressions and in developed international markets. Sell-side analysts incorporate news about linked stocks sluggishly. These effects are stronger for complex and indirect linkages. These results indicate that previously documented momentum spillover effects represent a unified phenomenon that is captured by shared analyst coverage.
G14|Identifying Price Informativeness|We show that outcomes (parameter estimates and R-squareds) of regressions of prices on fundamentals allow us to recover exact measures of the ability of asset prices to aggregate dispersed information. Formally, we show how to recover absolute and relative price informativeness in dynamic environments with rich heterogeneity across investors (regarding signals, private trading needs, or preferences), minimal distributional assumptions, multiple risky assets, and allowing for stationary and non-stationary asset payoffs. We implement our methodology empirically, finding stock-specific measures of price informativeness for U.S. stocks. We find a right-skewed distribution of price informativeness, measured in the form of the Kalman gain used by an external observer that conditions its posterior belief on the asset price. The recovered mean and median are 0.05 and 0.02 respectively. We find that price informativeness is higher for stocks with higher market capitalization and higher trading volume.
G14|Partisan Professionals: Evidence from Credit Rating Analysts|Partisan perception affects the actions of professionals in the financial sector. Using a novel dataset linking credit rating analysts to party affiliations from voter records, we show that analysts who are not affiliated with the U.S. president's party downward-adjust corporate credit ratings more frequently. By comparing analysts with different party affiliations covering the same firm in the same quarter, we ensure that differences in firm fundamentals cannot explain the results. We also find a sharp divergence in the rating actions of Democratic and Republican analysts around the 2016 presidential election. Our results suggest partisan perception has implications for firms' cost of capital.
G14|Investor Rewards to Climate Responsibility: Evidence from the 2016 Climate Policy Shock|Donald Trump's election and his nomination of Scott Pruitt, a climate skeptic, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency drastically downshifted expectations on US climate-change policy. We study firms' stock-price reactions and institutional investors' portfolio adjustments after these events. As expected, carbon-intensive firms benefited. Should not companies with responsible strategies on climate change have lost value, since they were paying for actions that were now less urgent? In fact, investors actually rewarded such firms. The premium the firms received resulted, at least in part, from the move into climate-responsible stocks by long-horizon investors presumably expecting a post-Trump rebound to green policy.
G14|Media Sentiment and International Asset Prices|We assess the impact of media sentiment on international equity prices using more than 4.5 million Reuters articles published across the globe between 1991 and 2015. News sentiment robustly predicts daily returns in both advanced and emerging markets, even after controlling for known determinants of stock prices. But not all news-sentiment is alike. A local (country-specific) increase in news optimism (pessimism) predicts a small and transitory increase (decrease) in local returns. By contrast, changes in global news sentiment have a larger impact on equity returns around the world, which does not reverse in the short run. We also find evidence that news sentiment affects mainly foreign – rather than local – investors: although local news optimism attracts international equity flows for a few days, global news optimism generates a permanent foreign equity inflow. Our results confirm the value of media content in capturing investor sentiment.
G14|Relationship between tick size reduction and price information of open limit order book|In this study, I examine the effects from tick size reduction in 2014 at Tokyo Stock Ex- change to price discovery of the limit order book by using tick-by-tick data from TOPIX100 stocks. Typically, both spreads and depths decline after tick size reduction. This fact has been confirmed in this study too. I examine the effects of changes in trader fs behavior which is caused by changes in the shape of limit order book. The results suggest that the information of an efficient price became more likely to be reflected by market orders than limit orders after tick size reduction.
G14|Who Influences the Fundamental Value of Commodity Futures in Japan?|We present evidence on asymmetric information content in the trades of six investor groups transacting in the gold, platinum, gasoline and rubber futures markets on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Microstructure theory suggests that traders with greater information on the efficient price should be more profitable in the long run. Foreign investors have the greatest influence over the efficient price in the gold market, investment funds in the platinum market and retail investors in the gasoline market. Both trade and non-trade related innovations have an equal influence on the efficient price of rubber, with trades by investment funds having the largest information content in this market. We relate differences in the relative influence of investor groups to differences in market interconnectedness, the nature of the commodity and associated fundamental information.
G14|Information Aggregation in Emissions Markets with Abatement|A key policy argument in favor of emissions markets (relative to command-and-control types of regulation) is their ability to aggregate dispersed information and generate price signals to guide firms trading and abatement decisions. We investigate this argument in a multi-period model where firms receive noisy private signals about their current period emissions and privately observe their previous period emissions before this information is made public to the rest of the market. Firms respond to information by trading and abating emissions. We show that there exists a rational expectations equilibrium that fully aggregates firms private information, justifying the policy argument in favor of emissions markets, in the absence of other frictions. We also derive predictions about how prices should be reacting to new private or public information and show that the possibility of abatement dampens the impact of shocks on prices. Finally, we show that the information aggregation result breaks down if firms abatement costs are also private information. JEL Codes: G14, D83, D84, D85, Q58. Keywords: Information Aggregation, Efficient Market Hypothesis, Price Formation, Emissions Trading.
G14|Financial Diversification before WW1 : A Risk/Return Analysis of Portfolio’s Advice of French Financial Analyst Alfred Neymarck|In this paper, we propose an original analysis of advice given by financial analysts prior to WW1. Our paper focuses on the writings of A. Neymarck, one of the most popular French analysts in the early 20th Century. The creation of portfolios from a new database composed of the monthly returns of all the security types listed on the Paris Stock Exchange from 1903 to 1912 has provided results demonstrating that Neymarck correctly identified the risk in various sectors. The performances of the portfolios built according to Neymarck’s guidelines reveal the ranking announced by the analyst, both in terms of risk and in terms of return: the richer the investor, the riskier and the more profitable his portfolio was seen to be. Finally, the construction of optimal portfolios according to the Modern Portfolio Theory enables us to pinpoint the few imperfections of Neymarck’s advice, which nevertheless appears to be driven by solid financial analysis.
G14|Corruption and tax compliance: Evidence from small retailers in Bamako, Mali|We investigate the impact of corruption on tax compliance using a sample of 700 small business in Bamako, Mali. Our results show that paying bribes reduced tax compliance by almost ten percentage points.
G14|O Mercado Segurador em Portugal: O Papel dos Gestores na Constituição de Provisões|As empresas seguradoras têm que constituir provisões técnicas com vista a assegurar que responsabilidades futuras perante os seus clientes e terceiros são cobertas. Estas provisões baseiam-se em estimativas não só incorporando dados passados, mas incluindo igualmente as expectativas de evolução da economia e da própria empresa. É assim expectável que o grau de otimismo dos diretores financeiros das empresas (Chief Financial Officers, CFOs) e as expectativas que criam estejam associadas às provisões que calculam e registam. Analisando as consequências da racionalidade limitada dos agentes económicos, das suas preferências sociais e na ausência de autocontrolo, Richard Thaler mostrou como estes traços humanos afetam sistematicamente as decisões individuais e os resultados, o que lhe conferiu a atribuição do prémio Nobel da Economia de 2017. O presente artigo encontra uma relação negativa entre o otimismo dos CFOs, e a constituição de provisões no mercado segurador em Portugal, no período compreendido entre 2007 e 2016. Estes resultados que têm impacto no ambiente concorrencial deverão interessar os reguladores, os acionistas e os profissionais do sector.
G14|Unobserved structural shifts and asymmetries in the random walk model for stock returns in African frontier markets|The purpose of this study is to examine the weak-form market efficiency hypothesis (EMH) for 8 African Frontier markets (Nairobi Securities Exchange of Kenya, the Nigerian Stock Exchange of Nigeria, Botswana Stock Exchange of Botswana, Zimbabwe Stock Exchange of Zimbabwe, Johannesburg Stock Exchange of South Africa, Egyptian Exchange of Egypt, Casablanca Stock Exchange of Morocco, the Tunis Stock Exchange of Tunisia). To achieve this purpose we employ unit root testing procedures which are robust to both nonlinearities and smooth structural breaks. To further allow for vigorousness in our empirical analysis we employ two time series datasets for each of the capital markets, namely daily and weekly time series. To the best of our knowledge, our study becomes the first, to investigate the weak-form EMH for all 8 African frontier markets whilst simultaneously accounting for asymmetries and smooth structural breaks. Our empirical findings suggest that most African frontier markets are not market efficient, in the weak sense form, with the exception of the Kenyan stock market and to a very much lesser extent the Botswana and South African stock series. Important policy and investor implications are drawn in our study.
G14|Bubbles and financial professionals|The efficiency of financial markets and their potential to produce bubbles are central topics in academic and professional debates. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the contribution of financial professionals to price efficiency. To close this gap, we run 86 experimental markets with 294 professionals and 384 students. We report that professional markets with bubble-drivers-capital inflows or high initial capital supply-are susceptible to bubbles, but they are significantly more efficient than student markets. In a survey with 245 professionals and students we show that cognitive skills and risk attitudes do not explain subject pool differences in bubble formation.
G14|Bargeld, Giralgeld, Vollgeld: Zur Diskussion um das Geldwesen nach der Finanzkrise|Der Aufsatz setzt sich kritisch mit verschiedenen Vorschlägen zur Reform des Geldwesens seit der Finanzkrise und mit den zugrundeliegenden Vorstellungen von „Geld“ auseinander. Das Wort „Geld“ wird in dieser Diskussion für verschiedene Dinge und in verschiedenen Bedeutungen gebraucht. Als paradox erweist es sich, dass die Diskussion um die Geldpolitik, auch die Rechtsprechung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts, geprägt ist von der Vorstellung, dass die Ausgabe von Bargeld eine Verbindlichkeit der Zentralbank darstellt, ebenso die Einlagen der Geschäftsbanken bei der Zentralbank, während gleichzeitig die Diskussion um die Rolle der Geschäftsbanken im Geldwesen geprägt ist von der Vorstellung, dass diese durch ihre Kreditvergabe „Geld“ schöpfen und somit die Einlagenfinanzierung von Geschäftsbanken keine Schuldenfinanzierung ist. Beide Vorstellungen sind falsch, die eine, weil die Geldschöpfung der Zentralbank diese zu nichts verpflichtet, die andere, weil die Geldschöpfung der Geschäftsbanken sehr wohl Verpflichtungen schaffen, die Liquiditäts- und Solvenzrisiken mit sich bringen. Der zweite Teil des Aufsatzes geht kritisch auf radikale Reformvorschläge zur Abschaffung des Bargelds und zur Abschaffung der Geldschöpfung der Geschäftsbanken (Vollgeld-Initiative) ein. Erstere unterschätzen die Rolle des Bargelds als Grundlage aller auf Nominalwerte gerichteten Forderungen, u.a. der Forderungen an Geschäftsbanken, letztere unterschätzen die Möglichkeiten und die Risiken einer Substitution von Sichteinlagen durch andere „geldnahe“ Titel, z.B. Geldmarktfondsanteile. Die Vorstellung, man könne durch solche Änderungen die Komplexität der Interdependenz von Geldsystem und Banksystem reduzieren und die Aufgabe der Geldpolitik vereinfachen, ist unrealistisch.
G14|Trading and information diffusion in OTC markets|We model trading and information diffusion in OTC markets, when dealers can engage in many bilateral transactions at the same time. We show that information diffusion is effective, but not efficient. While each bilateral price partially reveals all dealers' private information after a single round of trading, dealers could learn more even within the constraints imposed by our environment. This is not a result of dealers' market power, but arises from the interaction between decentralization and differences in dealers' valuation of the asset. We apply our framework to confront several explanations for the disruption of OTC markets with stylized facts from the empirical literature. We find more support for narratives emphasizing increased counterparty risk as opposed to increased informational frictions.
G14|Information acquisition, price informativeness, and welfare|We consider the market for a risky asset with heterogeneous valuations. Private information that agents have about their own valuation is reflected in the equilibrium price. We study the learning externalities that arise in this setting, and in particular their implications for price informativeness and welfare. When private signals are noisy, so that agents rely more on the information conveyed by prices, discouraging information gathering may be Pareto improving. Complementarities in information acquisition can lead to multiple equilibria.
