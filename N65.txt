N65|Land consolidation as technical change: impacts on-farm and off-farm in rural Vietnam|This paper studies whether land consolidation – reduction of land fragmentation – promotes or hinders the Vietnamese government’s policy objectives of encouraging agricultural mechanization and stimulation of the off-farm rural economy. It does this by viewing land consolidation as a form of technical change, making it possible to apply the insights developed in the economic literature on technical change. This treatment reveals that the impacts of land consolidation depend partly on its factor bias and partly on the degree to which labor is substitutable in production for other factors. At a theoretical level, if a technical change is factor neutral, it will reduce off-farm labor supply and slow rural structural transformation away from agriculture; if it is labor-augmenting and the elasticity of substitution between factors is low enough, the opposite effects are predicted. The paper studies these issues empirically for rice production in Vietnam, focusing on the impact that consolidation of rice land has on rice production, machinery use, and labor allocation. The findings confirm that land consolidation raises both farm productivity and farm income and stimulates increased machinery use. It also reduces farm labor supply, lowers labor intensity in farming, and thereby releases more farm labor to off-farm development, consistent with government policy objectives. Based on these findings, the paper concludes that land consolidation should be encouraged through development of land ownership rights and the promotion of land rental markets.
N65|The Strategies of Integration on the Textile Companies in the Meiji Period :A Case Study the Kyoto Cotton Flannel Co. Ltd|The purpose of this study is to discuss the significance of the vertically and horizontal integration focus on the textile companies in the Meiji Period. It has been widely accepted that the process was initiated by those formed as spinning companies, which later acquired the weaving sector by mergers and acquisitions because of recession. This paper is to show an alternative way of vertical integration of spinning and weaving processes in cotton industry in early Meiji Japan through a case study of the Kyoto Cotton Flannel Co., Ltd(the Kyomen). Cotton flannel is a finished cotton textile napped on side made to imitate wool flannel. Full-fledged, factory-based machine printing in Japan started to develop when the Kyomen was established in 1895. The Kyomen actively transferred technology for raising the nap of the cloth, dyeing and processing to European. The industry faced various quality problems caused by inexperience in machine printing technique and copper roller engraving. This study provide evidence that the Kyomen was the first Japanese company which overcame these challenges. It was worthwhile to note that the Kyomen achieve vertical integration process by acquisition of Kyoto Spinning Company. Since then, it internalized the spinning process and became able to improve the self-manufactured cotton yarn to fit in printing and napping. It made it possible to improve the quality of cotton flannels. When the competition in this industry is fierce after the Russo-Japanese War, the Kyomen was developing aggressive horizontal integration in order to break out of dependence on the sales cotton flannels. Although the Kyomen failed to finance them and went bankrupt in 1909, it filled an importance role in the rise of the machine textile printing industry in Japan.
N65|The Development Effects of the Extractive Colonial Economy: The Dutch Cultivation System in Java|Colonial powers typically organized economic activity in the colonies to maximize their economic returns. While the literature has emphasized long-run negative economic impacts via institutional quality, the changes in economic organization implemented to spur production historically could also directly influence economic organization in the long-run, exerting countervailing effects. We examine these in the context of the Dutch Cultivation System, the integrated industrial and agricultural system for producing sugar that formed the core of the Dutch colonial enterprise in 19th century Java. We show that areas close to where the Dutch established sugar factories in the mid-19th century are today more industrialized, have better infrastructure, are more educated, and are richer than nearby counterfactual locations that would have been similarly suitable for colonial sugar factories. We also show, using a spatial regression discontinuity design on the catchment areas around each factory, that villages forced to grow sugar cane have more village owned land and also have more schools and substantially higher education levels, both historically and today. The results suggest that the economic structures implemented by colonizers to facilitate production can continue to promote economic activity in the long run, and we discuss the contexts where such effects are most likely to be important.
N65|Food security, food safety and pesticides: China and the EU compared|To control pests that may damage crops during production, storage or transportation, chemical pesticides are usually used. On the one hand, the use of pesticides can help to reduce yield losses caused by pests, pathogens, and weeds and thereby help feed the world’s population; on the other hand, such agricultural practices can profoundly affect limited natural resources. Starting from these premises, the main objective of this paper is to explore the relationship between food security and food safety, while pointing out the role played in this relationship by pesticides, focusing on the case studies of the EU and China. To this purpose, the paper outlines the international framework on pesticides and the legal framework in the EU and China, analyzes pesticide markets, and considers the concerns related to their use. The overview of the situation in the EU and China allows us to identify challenges and opportunities for future developments in terms of food security and safety and food trade relationships between Europe and China. Tension and mutual disputes have occurred in the past due to increasing risks for consumers and workers handling pesticides, food scandals and difficulties in the mutual recognition of food quality certification schemes, which call for sustainable production methods.
N65|Structural Change in Mass-Procurement Systems: China’s Iron and Steel Industry and the Global Iron Ore Market|This paper was originally presented at the 1stWorld Congress on Business History/ This study aims to describe historical trends in the “mass-procurement system” for iron ore, which for many years has been the largest non-fuel natural resource in terms of trade value. Wefocus on China because it reflects globaltrendsmost comprehensively. Throughmodern history, all large steel producers have established their own iron ore mass-procurement systems. We can classify thesesystemsinto three major modes:“captive mine”,“long-term contract (LTC)”,and “spot trading.” We found that in China, traditional state-owned steel companies such as Anshan Iron and Steel (Ansteel)adopted the captive-mine mode from the prewar period, like the Americans. On the other hand, the newly established leadingcompany Baoshan Iron and Steel (Baosteel) introduced the LTC mode, following the innovationof this mode by Japanese companies in the 1980s. Then, in the early twenty-first century, China’smass-procurement system for iron ore further diversifiedwhich establishedthe spot-trading mode as the third mass-procurement system. As a result, many steel companies tended to create a portfolio of sourcing modes.
N65|Assessing the role of inward foreign direct investment in Chinese economic development, 1990–2007: Towards a synthesis of alternative views|In the context of globalization, China has been widely regarded as the most successful country in the world in utilizing inward foreign direct investment (FDI) for economic development. The mainstream of the literature has produced a wide range of studies that are largely within the theoretical framework of neoclassical economics, and they tend to conclude that FDI has contributed significantly to Chinese economic development—through capital formation, export expansion, technology transfer, and the transformation of the economic structures and institutions. The objective of this paper is to assess the role of FDI in Chinese economic development with reference to the broader theoretical literature on FDI and late development, which encompasses structuralism and radical political economy along with neoclassical economics. From the perspectives of the broader literature, the analyses of the paper find that FDI in China has indeed promoted economic development in one respect (improving allocative efficiency), but has also had unfavourable effect in another respect (worsening productive efficiency), resulting in an overall impact that tends to be on the negative side. The mainstream story of China is thus judged to be partial, and the lessons to be drawn from the experience are arguably far more complex than have been hitherto perceived.
N65|Highways, Market Access and Urban Growth in China|We investigate the effects of the construction of the national highway system in China on local economic outcomes. The analysis employs three main approaches. The first is based on a structural model of Ricardian trade that provides an explicit description of the general equilibrium effects of changes in the highway network. The second involves reduced form estimates of the casual effects highways, which accommodates the non-random assignment of highways across locations. The third approach is a hybrid of the first two. Technique matters. The structural model suggests that access to domestic markets, but not to export markets, increases economic output. The reduced form estimates suggest the opposite conclusion and also point to the importance of highways in the rise of regional primate cities. These reduced form findings are consistent with export driven growth policies and central or provincial government policies favouring regional primate cities. In addition to informing policy, our results raise concerns about the use of quantitative results from Ricardian trade models in isolation for understanding how and the extent to which infrastructure drives regional growth.
N65|Is the Value Addition in Services and Manufacturing Complementary? Empirical Evidence from SAARC|Most empirical studies on sectoral change provide evidence in favor of the complementarities between manufacturing and services, claiming that both sectors generally grow in parallel. This study investigates the complementarities hypothesis for the SAARC countries, which have dominant services sectors but have not graduated to industrial status. We ask whether the rapid growth and value addition of services presents an opportunity or threat for value addition in manufacturing, when the latter sector is still at a premature stage. Our findings do not validate the complementarities between manufacturing and services overall in the case of the SAARC countries. However, there appear to be potential complementarities once services is interacted with trade variables.

N65|From Commodity Booms to Economic Miracles: Why Southeast Asian Industry Lagged Behind|Except for the Philippines between 1896 and 1939, Southeast Asia was never part of the century-long East Asian industrial catching up until after World War II. Before the 1950s, Southeast Asian manufacturing hardly grew at all: while commodity export processing did grow fast, import-competing manufacturing and manufacturing for local consumption did not. Singapore and Thailand started recording catching up growth rates on the western leaders only from the 1950s onwards, and Indonesia and Malaysia joined the club only after 1973. Even then, Southeast Asia did not record catching up growth rates on Japan or Taiwan until after 1973 and 1990, respectively. The only Southeast Asian country that appeared to have joined the fast industrial growth club before World War II – the Philippines -- had its industrial growth collapse after the ISI years. What explains this dismal industrial performance before the 1960s? Why did Southeast Asia become a rapid export-led manufacturing growth success story after the 1960s while it did not in Latin America, the Middle East, or South Asia? In seeking answers, we distinguish four periods: de-industrialization and commodity export growth before 1913; a modest diversification into manufacturing during WWI and the interwar years; the development of consumer goods production under import substitution policies between the 1940s and the 1960s; and finally the high speed export-led industrialization since. We show how factor endowments, demography, schooling, second-best institutions, foreign markets, and, especially, good luck mattered.
N65|From the Phased Manufacturing Programme to Frugal Engineering: Some Initial Propositions|Although the structural reforms, initiated in 1991, did not lead to any appreciable increase in either the efficiency or the export orientation of Indian manufacturing firms, unexpectedly, there has been a visible improvement in manufacturing design capabilities in certain segments, for instance, in the motor vehicle sector. The paper suggests that the development of “frugal engineering”—an approach of “frugality” in resolving complex design problems—is a real advance. It suggests, further, that this approach developed from the experiences of the procedures laid down in the phased manufacturing programme of the 1950s, and first found expression in the successful forays into some specific export markets by Indian vehicle manufacturers in the late 1970s and 1980s. Although this design expertise cannot solve the problems of manufacturing efficiency, particularly across the wider industrial sphere, it indicates that Indian firms have the expertise to resolve problems related to the manufacturing sphere if strategic goals are appropriately set by managers.

His works emphasize that economic history can guide future economic policy. Current problems in Indonesia were resulted from past policy failures. Indonesia needs to consistently embark on open economic policies, free itself from ""colonial period mentality"". Investment should be made in rebuilding crumbling infrastructure, improving the quality of health and education services, and addressing poor law enforcement. If current corruption persists, Indonesia could not hope to become a dynamic and prosperous country."
N65|Malaysia NAP: More Shadows than Lights|After World War II, and in particular during the 1960s and the 1970s, many developing countries began their industrial revolution path. In particular, most of them followed a path of government-led industrial development, with central planning at the heart of the industrial policy. Such a model is not new in economic history and it is typical of many ‘second-comers’ in the industrialization process. The most famous one is the case of Prussia/Germany: with the Zollverein (1833-34) and after the unification in 1870, it was the government which stimulated the development of a powerful heavy industrial system, following what was preached at the time by Friedrich List. In particular, the key point of List preaching was that second-comers countries need to protect their industrialization process (characterized by infant industries) from foreign competition. According to List, once the protected industries reach an adequate competitive level, protection should be removed and the national companies should face competition in the market, in order to stimulate further technological development. Many second-comers countries embraced this model; however, in most cases they failed to follow the second part of List’s recommendations: opening to the market in a second stage.
N65|Chinese National Income, ca. 1661–1933|This paper pulls together many primary and secondary sources to arrive at consistent estimates of national income for china between the 17th and 20th centuries. We find, in line with much of the literature, that GDP per capita declined between the mid-17th and 19th centuries. This trend reversed during the 19th century, mainly due to a shift into services and, for the late 19th century onwards, also in industry. Since these sectors exhibited higher labour productivity, this fostered economic growth. This pattern of decreasing share of services and industry from the 17th century and increasing shares in the 19th century is common in many Asian countries except Japan. The reasons for this development, however, are unclear. The standard ultimate factors of growth such as institutions (low marriage age for women, exclusive society) and geography apply to almost all Asian countries. Hence, more research is necessary.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N65|Acquisitions, Productivity, and Profitability: Evidence from the Japanese Cotton Spinning Industry|We explore how changes in ownership affect the productivity and profitability of producers. Using detailed data from the Japanese cotton spinning industry at the turn of the last century, we find that acquired firms' production facilities were not on average less physically productive than the plants of the acquiring firms before acquisition. They were much less profitable, however, due to higher inventory levels and lower capacity utilization—differences that reflected problems in managing the uncertainties of demand. After acquisitions, less profitable acquired plants saw drops in inventories and gains in capacity utilization that raised both their productivity and profitability levels.

N65|Compact organizational space and technological catch-up: Comparison of China's three leading automotive groups|This study examines why compact organizational space may matter for technological catch-up, through a comparison of China's leading automotive groups. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) surpasses its two local rivals in terms of technological capabilities partly because the firm has managed its organizational space in close connection with intensive growth strategies at the group level. SAIC has greatly benefited from compact organizational space in building technological capabilities, as it encourages the mobilization and integration of internal resources and promotes group-wide synergy for an effective internalization of acquired assets.
N65|From Commodity Booms to Economic Miracles: Why Southeast Asian Industry Lagged Behind|We propose a formal re-definition of the concept market failure based on the idea of the imperfect state. In the Neo-classical taxonomy, a decentralized regime of exchange is a market failure if its laissez faire equilibrium solution is welfare-dominated by a technically feasible alternative. If the state is perfect, that is, benevolent and its transactions cost of intervention is zero, every market failure can be remedied/corrected with a welfare gain. If the state is imperfect, that is, either non-benevolent or with non-zero transactions cost, the state intervention to correct the market failure can be welfare-reducing. Extending the logic behind Williamson’s remediableness criterion and Stiglitz’ constrained Paretoness, we introduce a new taxonomy of failures: the concept “proto-failure” now denotes any failure which laissez faire interaction cannot remedy without a welfare gain. The label “market failure” now denotes a proto-failure which the relevant state can correct with a welfare gain. A proto-failure that the relevant state cannot correct with a welfare gain we call “RC efficient.” We use the net welfare metric which explicitly accounts for transactions cost of intervention as efficiency criterion. The new taxonomy is equivalent to the old if the state is perfect, that is, all proto failures are market failures. When the state is imperfect, the set of market failures is smaller than the set of proto-failures. A proto-failure is a necessary--but not a sufficient--condition for a welfare-improving government intervention. This paper follows the Williamson counsel to “push the logic of positive transactions cost to completion.”
N65|China’s Great Convergence and Beyond|A recent wave of economic research has studied the transformation of China from a poor country in the 1970s to a middle-income economy today. Based on this literature, we discuss the factors driving China’s development process. We provide a historical account of China’s rise, fall, and resurgence. We then discuss the stylized facts associated with China’s growth process and review a comprehensive theory of its economic transition. Finally, we discuss China’s future. In particular, we review some recent studies about technological and politico-economic factors that may foster or hinder its future economic performance.
N65|Does higher productivity and efficiency lead to spillover? evidence from Indian manufacturing|This paper empirically analyzes spillover effects from foreign direct investment using the firm level panel data of Indian manufacturing during 2000-01 and 2009-10. It first estimates the productivity and efficiency of the domestic and foreign firms separately before examining the spillover effects by using PROWESS dataset. The use of the Cobb-Douglas production function for productivity and stochastic frontier approach for efficiency reveals higher productivity and efficiency of the foreign firms over their domestic counterparts. Similarly, the findings show a significant impact of FDI on output growth. This indicates that any increase in foreign equity at the firm and sector level directly affects productivity. We attempt to find the possible reason for positive spillover effects by analyzing the detail of the present trends and the dataset.
N65|Did Japanese direct investment in Korea suppress indigenous industrialization in the 1930s? : evidence from country-level factory entry patterns|Foreign direct investment (FDI) can deliver both positive and negative spillovers to the local economy. Negative effects such as crowding-out or entry-barrier effects might outweigh the positive ones when the technological gap between foreign and local firms is significant. This paper examines the impact of Japanese direct investment into Korea under colonization in the 1930s on the entry of Korean-owned factories. By using the census of manufacturing factories in Korea, we exploit variations in the share of Japanese factories and their entry rates across counties within the same subsectors. We find that within a subsector, entry rates of Korean factories were higher in counties with higher presence and entry of Japanese factories. Positive correlations are also found between subsectors. The results imply that Japanese direct investment did not suppress the entry of Korean factories and that FDI could exert positive entry spillovers on indigenous firms, even at a very early stage of industrialization.
N65|Some Lessons from Korea's Industrialization Strategy and Experience|We look at Korea's industrialization strategy and experience from the 1960s to the mid-1990s. Three elements of the Korean industrial development and structural change are discussed: 1) its outward orientation and export push, 2) its climb up the ladder of comparative advantage, and 3) its economic management of the industrialization effort. Finally, we reflect on the lessons from the Korean experience.
N65|Cluster-based industrial development in contemporary developing countries and modern Japanese economic history|What are the similarities and dissimilarities in the pattern of cluster development between contemporary developing countries and modern Japanese economic history? This study attempts to examine the relevance of the Sonobe–Otsuka model, which is designed to explain the long-term process of cluster-based development in developing countries, for understanding the development process of silk-weaving clusters in prewar Japan. We discovered critical roles played by trade associations and local governments in internalizing the agglomeration economies in the development of the silk-weaving industry in Japan. We argue that further efforts are needed to explore the importance of trade associations and local governments in the development of industrial clusters in developing countries.
N65|Shanghai's Trade, China's Growth: Continuity, Recovery, and Change since the Opium Wars|This paper provides an analysis of China's trade performance from the 1840s to the present. Its focus is on Shanghai, the world's largest port, which began direct trade relations with Western nations starting in 1843. The paper finds that Shanghai had, and continues to have, an important role in China's trade structure. Applying the well-known gravity equation of trade for Shanghai's treaty port period, the paper shows that this relationship fits today's actual trade quite well when projected into the modern period. Second, the foreign presence, as measured by foreign direct investment (FDI), in Shanghai is shown to be related not only to trade in the past, but also to trade today, which suggests that FDI is one of the sources of persistence in foreign trade.

N65|The State, Industrialization and Competition: A reassessment of India's Leading Business Enterprises under Dirigisme|For over four decades after independence in 1947, India’s industrialization took place under a regime with an extensive system of controls over private capital. It is commonly believed that during this period of dirigisme, established dominant business families successfully manipulated the system to block competition from new firms and thereby perpetuated their dominance. This paper presents evidence to show that this perception conceals as much as it reveals. The process of industrialization between independence and the onset of liberalization in 1991 is actually marked by a combination of continuity with important shifts in the composition of Indian big business. The paper provides a framework for understanding this combination by revisiting the understanding of how business rivalry under Indian dirigisme actually worked. This is done by placing it within the context of dynamic industrialization and structural change, which unfolded within the specific economic, social and political realities of India. The paper shows that continuity and change amongst the leading private business enterprises had common roots in this competitive context.
N65|Financial governance and economic development: making sense of the Chinese experience|Despite fundamental market reforms, the Chinese financial system has remained a mixed system. From the perspectives of the mainstream doctrines of financial liberalization, this system is easily judged to be entailing serious allocative inefficiencies. Nevertheless, from alternative theoretical perspectives, the system might have been conducive to promoting productive efficiency. This paper argues that the actual experience does seem to indicate that, hitherto, the gains in productive efficiency have more than compensated for the losses in allocative efficiency. This judgement helps to make sense of the Chinese anomaly that a seemingly inefficient financial system has co-existed with the outstanding performance of financial deepening and economic development over the past three decades.
N65|Private Industry and the Second Five-Year Plan:The Mundhra Episode as Exemplar of Capitalist Myopia|The resignation of T T Krishnamachari from the finance ministership in early 1958 was the culmination of three developments evolving concurrently. The first was the M C Chagla Commission of Enquiry Report, which ultimately led to Jawaharlal Nehru accepting Krishnamachari’s resignation. The second, the “Mundhra episode” was media managed with the encouragement of industrial interests who found that the controls established as part of the industrialisation drive accompanying the Second Five-Year Plan made serious and unacceptable inroads in private capitalist decision-making. The third development involved social engineering, a concerted effort to push the bearers of merchant and usurer capital towards industrial capitalist norms. This paper, based on contemporary records, argues that the more profound reasons for Krishnamachari’s fall was the “Rama Rau affair” of late 1956. It holds that the institutional subordination of the Reserve Bank of India was intended to mould monetary policy to the requirements of industrial development. It concludes that Krishnamachari tripped in attempting to coerce street-smart businessmen in control of industry to behave like true industrialists.
N65|Technology transfer with requisitioned material from Germany: The impact of gPB reports h on Japanese postwar technological development|Toward the end of World War 2, British and U.S. governments created a joint program to investigate German technology and requisitioned numerous technical documentations, some of which were opened to public as technical reports. Japanese industries, refereeing them to as the gPB reports h, tried to obtain and utilize them for their postwar recovery until they started enthusiastic technology introduction by technology licensing in 1950 fs. This study describes the dissemination process of PB reports in Japan and evaluates their impact. A few engineers mainly in chemical industry who were belonged to companies, universities and national research institutes recognized the great value of PB reports, and then pressed Japanese government to introduce them with a State budged. Not only the individuals, but also the governmental organs established in the postwar democratization process of science and technology played important roles for policy making of package purchase of PB reports from U.S. government in 1952. In the case of dyestuff and caustic soda, some joint R&D groups were organized in academic circles and industrial associations to share the information from PB reports which contained classified factory data of IG Farben, Bayer and so on. Japanese companies utilized them to domesticate German chemical products and develop their original technologies. On the other hand, the case of electronics parts shows that small companies which could not afford to introduce technology from foreign companies by their own received benefit by the reports and got an opportunity for their development. As a result, a technology gap between Japan and advanced countries which had widened during the war were reduced till the end of 1950 fs.
N65|Business Activities of Yamanaka Hyouemon Family: The Case of the Gotenba-sake Branch in the Edo period|Yamanaka Hyouemon family who was one of Omi-Hino Merchants established the first and second branches in the Gotenba area located at the foot of Mt. Fuji in the Edo period. Focusing on the licenses to brew and the bookkeeping, this paper examines the business activities of the second Gotenba branch (the Gotenba-sake branch). As the conclusions, we could point out the following topics. 1) Yamanaka Family purchased a license to brew sake from the Gotenba village headman in 1801. Purchasing afterward more licenses and building breweries, Yamanaka Family laid the foundation of the sake brewing industry for a short period. 2) The Gotenba-sake branch brewed three types of sake: shiraume, morohaku, namishu. These sake prices were mainly affected by the rice prices. 3) The Gotenba-sake branch brewed sake on average 756 koku (136,374 litre) a year in 1835-1872. 4) The main business of the Gotenba-sake branch was to brew and sell sake, but the branch also sold soy sauce, salt, vinegar and rice bran. 5) The net assets of the Gotenba-sake branch showed the second largest volume of all five branches of Yamanaka family.

The main emphasis in this paper has been to explore the role of public expenditures development and non development) and macroeconomic uncertainty in determining private sector’s fixed investment in large scale manufacturing. It is found that most of the series are non-stationary and there is one cointegrating relationship between the private investment, public consumption expenditures, public development expenditures and size of market. The dynamic ECM model of private investment indicates public development expenditures enhance the private investment whereas non-development expenditures and macroeconomic uncertainty negatively affect private investment.

N65|Productivity and Growth: Least Absolute Deviation estimator and bootstrap techniques to predict aggregate production elasticities in the Palestinian manufacturing industry|We propose the estimation of a log-log Cobb-Douglas aggregate production function for the Palestinian industry. We find that traditional OLS estimates are not reliable they are bad predictors), due to the fact that only limited is available (small samples), and variables are characterised by high variability across time. The oligopolistic structure of the manufacturing sector also contributes. We propose to use bootstrap least deviance technique and find that the estimated elasticities are both significant and robust. For time-saving purposes (being inefficient to set-up the panel dataset), we apply the model to three available cross-sections of 71 manufacturing aggregates: 2000, 2002 and 2006 and find increasing returns to scale, which are supposed to reflect the imperfect competition of the market and/or the existence of high set-up or sunk costs which are mandatory in order to produce at all.

Studying countries that have integrated steelworks with largeblast furnaces (South Korea, Taiwan, China and India) and countries without(Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia), the paper shows the difference in thedevelopment processes across the countries and across time, and points to thediversity of the development experience of these countries. The paper argues thatsignificant differences in steel production technologies in terms of initial investmentand minimum-efficient scale, the changing role of the state, and shifting demandstructures in the domestic steel markets of each country have been the importantfactors that led to the differences in the development path of the steel industry ineach country.
N65|The Estimation of Technical Efficiency Effects Models with an Example Applied to the Thai Manufacturing Sector| This paper does two things. First, it presents alternative approaches to the standard methods of estimating productive efficiency using a production function. It favours a parametric approach (viz. the stochastic production frontier approach) over a nonparametric approach (e.g. data envelopment analysis); and, further, one that provides a statistical explanation of efficiency, as well as an estimate of its magnitude. Second, it illustrates the favoured approach (i.e. the â€˜single stage procedureâ€™) with estimates of two models of explained inefficiency, using data from the Thai manufacturing sector, after the crisis of 1997. Technical efficiency is modelled as being dependent on capital investment in three major areas (viz. land, machinery and office appliances) where land is intended to proxy the effects of unproductive, speculative capital investment; and both machinery and office appliances are intended to proxy the effects of productive, non-speculative capital investment. The estimates from these models cast new light on the five-year long, post-1997 crisis period in Thailand, suggesting a structural shift from relatively labour intensive to relatively capital intensive production in manufactures from 1998 to 2002.
N65|The Industrial Revolution in Miniature: The Spinning Jenny in Britain, France, and India|This paper uses the adoption and invention of the spinning jenny as a test case to understand why the industrial revolution occurred in Britain in the eighteenth century rather than in France or India. It is shown that wages were much higher relative to capital prices in Britain than in other countries. Calculation of the profitability of adopting the spinning jenny shows that it was profitable in Britain but not in France or in India. Since the jenny was profitable to use only in Britain, it was only in Britain that it was worth incurring the costs necessary to develop it. That is why the jenny was invented in Britain but not elsewhere. Irrespective of the quality of their institutions or the progressiveness of their cultures, neither the French nor the Indians would have found it profitable to mechanize cotton production in the eighteenth century.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

This paper examines the location advantages of border areas, in particular of those between less developed regions and more developed ones. They include complementary factor endowment, cross-border infrastructure services and the degree of economic integration and border barriers. An industry located in border areas has a growth potential, as it can exploit the location advantages of the abundant and cheap labor force in less developed regions, while avoiding high service link costs and unstable utility services that accrue from underdeveloped infrastructure in less developed regions, by utilizing cross-border infrastructure services provided from more developed regions. Special economic zones (SEZs) located in the border areas can effectively exploit such location advantages and contribute to the formation of industrial clusters in border areas.
N65|Poaching, Courts, and Settlements:Complementarity of Governance in Labor Markets|Transition between private governance mechanism and the state court is not necessarily unidirectional. This research assumes that non-monotonic changes in governance mechanism comes from complementarity between the private and public mechanisms when neither of both is sufficiently efficient. Then it studies transition of governance in the labor market of Japanese silk-reeling industry from the 1890s to the 1920s, which rapidly grew then and often showed poaching, and ascertains that employers first had recourse to the court for enforcement of employment contract, they second built private mechanisms for settlement backed by the court, and third abandoned the private mechanism.
