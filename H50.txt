H50|Production Network and International Fiscal Spillovers|This paper analyzes the impact of fiscal spending shocks in a multi-country model with international production networks. In contrast to standard results suggesting that production network linkages are unimportant for the aggregate response to macro shocks in a closed economy, we show that network structures may place a central role in the international propagation of fiscal shocks, particularly when wages are slow to adjust. The paper first develops a simple general equilibrium multi-country model and derives some analytical results on the response to fiscal spending shocks. We then apply the model to an analysis of fiscal spillovers in the Eurozone, using the calibrated sectoral network structure from the World Input Output Database (WIOD). In a version of the model with sticky wages, we find that fiscal spillovers from Germany and other some other large Eurozone countries may be large, and within the range of empirical estimates. More importantly, we find that the Eurozone production network very important for the international spillovers. In the absence of international production network linkages, spillovers would be only a third as large as predicted by the baseline model. Finally, we explore the diffusion of identified German government spending at the sectoral level, both within and across countries. We find that government expenditures have both significant upstream and downstream effects when these links are measured by the direction of sectoral production linkages.
H50|Expired and Expiring Authorizations of Appropriations: Fiscal Year 2019|CBO reports annually to the Congress on programs funded for the current fiscal year whose authorizations of appropriations have expired and on programs whose authorizations will expire during the current fiscal year.
H50|Expected Costs of Damage From Hurricane Winds and Storm-Related Flooding|Damage from hurricane winds, storm surges, and heavy rain imposes costs on private entities, such as households and businesses, and on all levels of government. By CBOâ€™s estimate, the expected economic losses (average losses over the long run) from most types of such damage total $54 billion per year: $34 billion to the residential sector, $9 billion to commercial businesses, and $12 billion to the public sector.
H50|Updated Budget Projections: 2019 to 2029|CBO estimates that the deficit for fiscal year 2019 will be $896 billion, which is $1 billion less than the agency estimated in January. If current laws generally remained unchanged, deficits would average 4.3 percent of gross domestic product over the 2020â€“2029 period. Other than the period immediately after World War II, the only other time the average deficit has been so large over so many years was after the 2007â€“2009 recession.
H50|An Analysis of the Presidentâ€™s 2020 Budget|By CBOâ€™s estimates, the federal deficit under the Presidentâ€™s budget would increase from $896 billion in 2019 to $966 billion (equal to 4.4 percent of gross domestic product, or GDP) in 2020. The cumulative deficit under the Presidentâ€™s policies would total $9.9 trillion over the 2020â€“2029 period, $1.5 trillion less than in CBOâ€™s baseline. (The Administration projects smaller deficits, totaling $7.3 trillion over that period.) Measured relative to the size of the economy, deficits would average 3.8 percent of GDP over the 10-year period, CBO estimates.
H50|An Evaluation of CBOâ€™s Past Deficit and Debt Projections|In this report, CBO analyzes its baseline projections of deficits and debt held by the public that were made each spring beginning in 1984. Each of those projections spanned the fiscal year already under way and five or 10 subsequent years.
H50|Fair-Value Estimates of the Cost of Federal Credit Programs in 2020|The federal government supports some private activities by providing credit assistance to individuals and businesses. CBO shows two kinds of estimates of the lifetime costs of those credit programs: estimates created by following procedures prescribed by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA); and estimates that account for the market value of the governmentâ€™s obligations, which are called fair-value estimates.
H50|The 2019 Long-Term Budget Outlook|If current laws generally remained unchanged, CBO projects, large budget deficits over the next 30 years would drive federal debt held by the public to unprecedented levelsâ€”from 78 percent of gross domestic product in 2019 to 144 percent by 2049. That level of debt would be the highest in the nationâ€™s history by far, and it would be on track to increase even more.
H50|The Distribution of Household Income, 2016|In 2016, average income before accounting for means-tested transfers and federal taxes was $21,000 for the lowest income quintile (fifth) of U.S. households and $291,000 for the highest quintile. Those transfers and taxes increased average household income toward the bottom of the income distribution and reduced income toward the top of the distribution. After accounting for the effects of transfers and taxes, CBO estimates that average household income for the lowest and highest quintiles was $35,000 and $214,000, respectively.
H50|CBOâ€™s Projections of Federal Receipts and Expenditures in the National Income and Product Accounts: 2019 to 2029|Federal receipts and expenditures in the national income and product accounts (NIPAs) differ in certain ways from revenues and outlays as shown in the federal budget. This report presents CBOâ€™s May 2019 baseline projections using the NIPA framework.
H50|Accounting for Federal Retirement and Veterans' Benefits: Cash and Accrual Measures|Programs that provide benefits to retired federal civilian workers, retired military personnel, and veterans have long-term effects on the federal budget. The governmentâ€™s cash payments for those benefits are reported in the budget as outlays when they are madeâ€”which means that the long-term costs of current decisions about those benefits are not reflected in the current budget deficit.
H50|An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2019 to 2029|CBO estimates that the federal budget deficit for 2019 will be $960 billion. Under current law, budget deficits are projected to average $1.2 trillion a year between 2020 and 2029, boosting debt held by the public to 95 percent of GDP in that yearâ€”its highest level since just after World War II. Economic output is projected to grow by 2.3 percent in 2019, supporting strong labor market conditions that feature low unemployment and rising wages. After 2019, in CBOâ€™s projections, economic growth averages 1.8 percent per year, which is less than the historical average.
H50|Budgetary Outcomes Under Alternative Assumptions About Fiscal Policy|In this report, CBO provides additional information about how its most recent budget projections would change under alternative assumptions about future fiscal policies and estimates the possible budgetary outcomes.
H50|Financial Regulation and the Federal Budget|Financial regulation affects the federal budget directly through spending for programs that support the stability of financial institutions and through the taxes and fees that those institutions pay. Regulation also affects the budget indirectly through its effects on the economy. Those effects generate a trade-off: Increased financial regulation may lower the likelihood of a financial crisis and mitigate the severity of any crisis that occurred, but it may also raise the cost of financing for investments.
H50|Population size and the size of government|We examine the effect of population size on government size for a panel of 130 countries for the period between 1970 and 2014. We show that previous analyses of the nexus between population size and government size were incorrectly specified, not accounting for cross-sectional dependence, non-stationarity and cointegration as well as parameter heterogeneity. Using a panel time-series approach that adequately models these issues, we find that population size has a positive long-run effect on government size. This finding suggests that the detrimental effects of population size on government size (primarily due to a greater risk of social conflict) dominate its beneficial ones (primarily due to scale economies). We also show that population size increases government size especially in countries that are vulnerable to social conflict due to ethnic heterogeneity.
H50|On the Effects of Sanctions on Trade and Welfare: New Evidence Based on Structural Gravity and a New Database|Using a new, global data base covering the years 1950 to 2015, we study the impact of sanctions on international trade and welfare. We make use of the rich dimensionality of our data and of the latest developments in the structural gravity literature. Starting with a broad evaluation by sanction type, we carefully investigate the case of Iran. Effects are significant but also widely heterogeneous across sanctioning countries. Moreover, they depend on the direction of trade. We also perform a counterfactual analysis which translates our partial equilibrium sanction estimates into heterogeneous but intuitive general equilibrium.
H50|Trade Tariff, Wage Gap and Public Spending|This paper studies the interplay between the wage gap and government spending in a small open economy facing a shock in trade policy. We consider a specific factor model with an export sector, which uses skilled labour, and an import-competing sector, which uses unskilled labour. We find the conditions under which there exists an inverse (direct) relation between trade lib-eralization (protection), which increases (decreases) the skilled-unskilled wage gap, and the level of government expenditure. We also show how either an unbalanced distribution of political bargaining power, or tariff revenue co-financing public spending may break this direct relation.
H50|How “Big” Should Government Be?|We assess how “big” government should reasonably be in a number of advanced countries. First, we will link the recent findings of Data Envelope Analysis on efficient public expenditure with the question of the size of the government. Second, we report descriptive analysis of various government performance indicators in relation to public expenditure to provide indications of overall “optimal” across spending categories. In principle, the highest savings potential is in the biggest expenditure categories, public consumption and social expenditure.

Los investigadores fueron llamados a comentar cada uno de los Pactos que conforman el documento del Gobierno de Iván Duque. *** In this document, we present the analysis of 23 scholars, invited by the CID to comment the National Development Plan 2018-2022 “Pacto por Colombia pacto por la Equidad”. The researchers were asked to comment on each one of the specific Agreements that are included in the Law by Duque’s Government.
H50|Why Do Fiscal Multipliers Depend on Fiscal Positions?|The fiscal position can affect fiscal multipliers through two channels. Through the Ricardian channel, households reduce consumption in anticipation of future fiscal adjustments when fiscal stimulus is implemented from a weak fiscal position. Through the interest rate channel, fiscal stimulus from a weak fiscal position heightens investors'concerns about sovereign credit risk, raises economy-wide borrowing cost, and reduces private domestic demand. The paper documents empirically the relevance of these two channels using an Interactive Panel Vector Auto Regression model. It finds that fiscal multipliers tend to be smaller when fiscal positions are weak than strong.
H50|Hurricanes, Climate Change Policies and Electoral Accountability|This paper studies how politicians and voters respond to new information on the threats of climate change. Using data on the universe of federal disaster declarations between 1989 and 2014, we document that congress members from districts hit by a hurricane are more likely to support bills promoting more environmental regulation and control in the year after the disaster. The response to hurricanes does not seem to be driven by logrolling behavior or lobbysts' pressure. The change in legislative agenda is persistent over time, and it is associated with an electoral penalty in the following elections. The response is mainly promoted by representatives in safe districts, those with more experience, and those with strong pro-environment records. Our evidence thus reveals that natural disasters may trigger a permanent change in politicians' beliefs, but only those with a sufficient electoral strength or with strong ideologies are willing to engage in promoting policies with short-run costs and long-run benefits.
H50|The fiscal lifetime cost of receiving refugees|This study estimates the fiscal consequences of receiving refugees, over the refugeesâ€™ lifetime. It uses data from Sweden in 2015, and the calculations account for refugeesâ€™ age, years since immigration, and country of origin. The estimated average annual fiscal net contribution over the lifetime of the average refugee (58 years) ranges from â€“12 per cent of GDP per capita for refugees from the countries of origin for which labor market performance has historically been the strongest, to â€“22 per cent for those for which it has been the weakest. The estimates imply that if the European Union received all refugees currently in Asia and Africa, the implied average annual fiscal cost over the same time span would be at most 0.6 per cent of GDP.
H50|Sozialverträglicher CO2-Preis: Vorschlag für einen Pro-Kopf-Bonus durch Krankenversicherungen|CO2-Abgaben bergen die Gefahr, einkommensschwächere Haushalte überdurchschnittlich zu belasten. Zur Abwehr solcher regressiven Verteilungswirkungen wird erwogen, einen Teil der Einnahmen durch einen Pro-Kopf-Bonus an die Bürger*innen zurückzugeben. Der vorliegende Beitrag entwickelt einen Vorschlag für einen in das deutsche Krankenversicherungssystem integrierten Bonus. Dazu werden zunächst die Ziele definiert, die ein solcher Bonus verfolgen soll: Er soll die regressive Wirkung der CO2-Abgabe beseitigen, ohne die beabsichtige Lenkungswirkung der CO2-Abgabe zu beeinträchtigen. Zugleich sollen die Verwaltungskosten und die Befolgungskosten der Steuer und des Kompensationsmechanismus möglichst gering sein. Schließlich soll der Mechanismus von möglichst vielen Berechtigten auch tatsächlich in Anspruch genommen werden. Danach werden die institutionellen Details vorgestellt: Der Pro-Kopf-Bonus sollte so weit wie möglich durch Leistung von Zuschüssen über die Krankenversicherungen abgewickelt werden; gesonderte Mechanismen müssten für Empfänger von Transferzahlungen und für Empfänger von Heilfürsorge vorgesehen werden. Abschließend werden die Voraussetzungen dafür aufgezeigt, dass ein solcher Vorschlag mit den verfassungsrechtlichen Vorgaben im Einklang steht.
H50|Taking stock of the functioning of the EU fiscal rules and options for reform|This paper reviews developments in fiscal rules in the European Union (EU) from the entering into force of the Treaty on European Union (the “Maastricht Treaty”), which laid the foundations for the euro, until today. It seems safe to say that fiscal positions in the EU and the euro area are now more favourable than they would have been in the absence of the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). However, the aggregate picture masks significant cross-country heterogeneity, with less progress where it would be needed most. Furthermore, the design of the rules has not always followed economic logic and has often been the product of political constraints, giving rise to some flaws in the framework from the outset. Repeated attempts to adjust the fiscal framework to a multitude of circumstances over the past 25 years have made it overly complex and incoherent. The paper concludes that, in its current shape, the SGP is an insufficient disciplining device in economic good times, with the consequence that there are no fiscal buffers, particularly in high-debt countries, to support growth in economic troughs. This, together with the absence of a central fiscal stabilisation instrument, puts the burden of stabilisation mostly on the single monetary policy. The paper also reviews reform options on how to render the fiscal framework more effective in bringing about sounder public finances and avoiding the procyclicality observed over the past two decades.

H50|Fiscal Stimulus Under Sovereign Risk|"The excess procyclicality of fiscal policy is commonly viewed as a central malaise in emerging economies. We document that procyclicality is more pervasive in countries with higher sovereign risk and provide a model of optimal fiscal policy with nominal rigidities and endogenous sovereign default that can account for this empirical pattern. Financing a fiscal stimulus is costly for risky countries and can render countercyclical policies undesirable, even in the presence of large Keynesian stabilization gains. We also show that imposing austerity can backfire by exacerbating the exposure to default, but a well-designed ""fiscal forward guidance"" can help reduce the excess procyclicality."

H50|Incumbency Disadvantage of Political Parties: The Role of Policy Inertia and Prospective Voting|"We document that postwar U.S. elections show a strong pattern of “incumbency disadvantage"": If a party has held the presidency of the country or the governorship of a state for some time, that party tends to lose popularity in the subsequent election. To explain this fact, we employ Alesina and Tabellini's (1990) model of partisan politics, extended to have elections with prospective voting. We show that inertia in policies, combined with sufficient uncertainty in election outcomes, implies incumbency disadvantage. We find that inertia can cause parties to target policies that are more extreme than the policies they would support in the absence of inertia and that such extremism can be welfare reducing."

H50|Sharia banking standard law|Abstract The adoption of a standard agreement from the beginning of its birth has caused controversy both concerning the existence and validity of standard contracts. The Civil Code does not specifically regulate standard agreements. This writing focuses on two issues, namely the validity of the agreement with the standard clause related to sharia principles and the consequences of the law lacking the principle of freedom of contract. This research is normative research that refers to legislation and jurisprudence using legal materials both primary and secondary. The legal material was collected through library studies and then analyzed qualitatively. This study concludes: first, the agreement with conventional standard clauses is no longer questioned whether the agreement is valid or not, but more importantly, the fairness of the contents of the standard clause and in the standard sharia contract tend to result in injustice. Second, normatively there are no legal consequences due to the absence of freedom of contract in the agreement.
H50|Modern Democracy-Welfare State and Public Goods. A current consequence for Greece|People expect the state to create jobs and provide them with a social security net. Whatever its defects, whatever the virtues of the private sector, no structure other than the state can today provide citizens with the basic public goods. Under the present right-wing government of Nea Dimokratia in Greece, which is not particularly at odds with neoliberalism, a very active role of the state is not expected. Also is nor expected the introduction of a serious program of public investment and demand boosting to stimulate the national economy and enter into a virtuous circle of recovery. Greece, which has undergone the economic crisis with drastic cuts in its traditionally deficient social state, has to respond directly to the marked underinvestment in public goods (in key areas such as education, health, natural disasters, dealing with decent living conditions).The most important tool for inputting resources is the tax system.
H50|Real level of public investment: how to manage the inflation?|When the government collects a supplementary indirect tax on an output, the price of that output increases by consequence. Then, using the resulting revenue for public investments will lead to an underconsumption of the total revenue invested. This is due to an inflation that has been created by this mechanism. This paper investigates the determination of the net amount of investment projects taking into account the effect of inflation. We use the computable general equilibrium model to test our hypothesis. As result, we show that, some simulations are needed in order to reach the equilibrium.

H50|The Importance of Defense Industry in Turkish Economy|This study analyzes the extent of economic importance of defense industry in Turkey by using SIPRI database for the period 1953 through 2018. For this purpose, firstly, the development pattern of Turkish total military expenditure (in constant 2017 US$) is evaluated over 66 years from 1953 to 2018. Next, the statistics on the military expenditure per capita (1988-2018) is analyzed in order to analyze how a change occurs on the expenditure with increasing population. In order to determine how the defense industry evolved in a developing economy, we also examine the expenditure statistics as a share of Turkish government expenditure (2000-2018 period) and GDP (1960-2018 period). Finally, the position and importance of the Turkish defense industry in the world, and in Europe and Middle East region is revealed when compared to other 173 countries. Main findings of the study could be summarized in the following way. The statistics reveal that the industry ranks 14th in the world and 6th in Europe, with a total expenditure of US$ 22B in 2018. Among top 100 arms-producing companies in the world, there are two Turkish companies, ASELSAN and Turkish Aerospace Industries, ranked as 61st and 70th in 2017, respectively. Although it is seen an increasing trend in the expenditures over 1960-2018 period, its share in GDP continuously falls over the same period, and reached to 2.5% in 2018. As the expenditures as a share of GDP, the industry ranks 27th in the world and 5th in Europe in 2018. When we examine per capita expenditures, it is seen an increasing trend over 1988-2018 period, and we see that there is five times increase from $50 in 1988 to $250 in 2010, and the industry ranks 46th in world with $232 per capita expenditure in 2018. When we analyze the share of expenditures in Turkish government spending over 2000-2018 period, it is found that the average is around 7% for 19 years, with the lowest 5.5% in 2015 and the highest 9.2% in 2000. As a share of government spending, there is a rapid downward trend in the expenditures from 2000 to 2015, this corresponds to 40% decrease, but this process is reversing after 2016, and reached to 7.1% in 2018.
H50|Corruption: Public and Private|Corruption is recognised as a major stumbling block to development and is associated with injustice and abuse of power. The consensus on the detrimental effects of corruption stands in contrast with the lack of agreement on the set of phenomena that fall under the heading Ã«corruptionÃ­ and there is little discussion on whether the economics of corruption should also include corruption in the private sector. This question is relevant since different foci will have different theoretical bases and policy ramifications. We analyse the issue from two complementary perspectives: whether the impacts of corruption are limited to corruption in the public sector and whether a large public sector is associated with more corruption. First, we review theoretical and empirical perspectives on corruption, showing how concern over corruption in the private sector has a long history, dating back to Marshall and Coase. Second, we analyse corruptionÃ­s determinants using a panel data approach. The econometric analysis demonstrates how our indicator of government involvement in the economy is a poor predictor of corruption prevalence. Finally, the paper highlights the policy implications of the one-sided focus on corruption in the public sector and proposes an explicit acknowledgment of the role of corruption in the private sector.
H50|Is the marginal cost of public funds equal to one?|In a recent article Bas Jacobs found that the marginal cost of public funds (MCF) is one when taxation gives second best resource allocation. This conclusion is based on a claim that there are certain shortcomings with the standard definition of MCF, for example that the size and sign of the standard MCF measure is sensitive to the choice of the untaxed good. A less frequently used definition of MCF is therefore applied instead. If a lump-sum tax is a marginal source for public revenue and taxation is optimal, MCF is one with the proposed definition. The contribution of the present paper is two-fold. First, it finds the standard MCF-measure is not sensitive to the choice of the untaxed good. Second, it finds that the proposed alternative definition has undesirable properties, for example that it could give negative MCF-measures along the upward sloping part of the Laffer curve and is sensitive to the choice of the untaxed good also in cases where this does not make sense. The present paper therefore concludes that there is a weak basis for the conclusion that MCF is one with optimal taxation.
H50|The costs of taxation in the presence of inequality|This paper provides a new and improved measure of the marginal cost of public funds (MCF). It is based on a benchmark tax which is distributionally neutral and non-distortive. This is in contrast to the MCF-measure used in the previous literature, that has used the regressive uniform lump-sum tax as the benchmark. Our proposed MCF-measure more precisely accounts for the distributional aspects of public funding (the tax scheme) and makes a clear distinction between this and the distributional aspects of the public good considered. Compared to the previous literature, we find a higher MCF both in the case of a uniform lump-sum tax and in the case of distortive taxes. Due to its regressive distributional consequences, we find that the MCF of a uniform lump-sum tax is always greater than one when not combined with distortive taxes. Moreover, we find that the MCF could be greater than one also with an optimal combination of a uniform lump-sum tax and distortive taxes.
H50|Serving God and Mammon: the ‘minerals-railway complex’ and its effects on colonial public finances in the British Cape Colony, 1810-1910|The resource curse literature underscores the fact that extractive economies face challenges in diversifying their economies. What is less explored are the public finance challenges encountered in these economies when the extractive industries are completely owned by the private sector. Using a recently compiled dataset on public revenues, expenditures and debt, this paper explores the nexus between the privatized extractive sector operations and public finance policies of the Cape Colony between 1810 and 1910. The paper finds that despite the natural resource endowment, the Cape Colony became heavily indebted and had huge budget deficits by the time it joined the Union of South Africa in 1910. After the discovery of diamonds, competition for resource-rents caused a slowdown and in some instances reversed the progress made in consolidating state institutions. The drive towards a national program of development inherent in self-governing colonies was overturned when the competition for resource-rents culminated in rent-seeking led by the interests in the monopolized extractive sector. Rather than being the main source of government revenues and a basis for inclusive economic progress, as expected in a self-governing settler colony, diamonds became a trap through the operations of what I call a ‘Minerals-Railway complex’. The insights from the paper have important implications for our understanding of both settler colonialism in Sub-Saharan Africa as well as the management of natural resources in developing economies.
H50|Is Public Sector Performance just a matter of money? The case of the Spanish regional governments|Efficient use of public resources is clearly a relevant issue to be studied from several points of view. Among others, it accounts for a significant share of the total economy activity and it deals with non market oriented activities. In Spain, the regional level is particularly relevant due to the progressive decentralization during the 200s of key public policies constituting the welfare state (as education, health, etc.). Consequently,it increased notably their financing needs but affecting asymmetrically because of the important differences in their fiscal capacity. Moreover, they mostly share (15 of 17) a common financing system in which an efficient use of resources is assumed but not evaluated. Our results show that normally a few of the regions tend to be the top performers, but there no regions performing poorly in every aspect. It is also worth noting that no dramatic changes can be seen in terms both of expenditure and performance during the recent Great Recession.
H50|Why Do Fiscal Multipliers Depend on Fiscal Positions?|The fiscal position can affect fiscal multipliers through two channels. Through the Ricardian channel, households reduce consumption in anticipation of future fiscal adjustments when fiscal stimulus is implemented from a weak fiscal position. Through the interest rate channel, fiscal stimulus from a weak fiscal position heightens investors’ concerns about sovereign credit risk, raises economy-wide borrowing cost, and reduces private domestic demand. We document empirically the relevance of these two channels using an Interactive Panel Vector Auto Regression model. We find that fiscal multipliers tend to be smaller when fiscal positions are weak than strong.
H50|Endogenous Convergence and International Technological Diffusion Channels|The goal of the paper is to estimate relative importance of channels of technological diffusion between new member states and core EU countries. Based on neoclassical growth theory and extensive literature survey on technological diffusion we explore movements in the relative TFP in EU member states and try to identify relative importance of channels of technological diffusion as suggested by theory: imports, exports, FDI, R&D, human capital and fixed capital formation, etc. In the first step we employ Phillips and Sul (2007) log t test which has power to detect convergence even in the absence of cointegration between time series. In the second part we employ Abrigo and Love (2016) PVAR model in order to detect channels of diffusion of technology. The data is sampled from Eurostat and PWT repository and covers the period from 1995-2016 for all EU member countries. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our preliminary results suggest that trade openness as an important channel for TFP diffusion. The overall results point that productivity gap reduction is a heterogeneous process, country specific problem, but on average it can be supported through various economic policies focused on openness. Relative importance of other factors of technological convergence is statistically less relevant or even has opposite direction of causality. Peculiar results for relative importance of FDI and R&D is further explored in terms of the structure and general nature of FDI flows during the investigated transition and accession period.
H50|The fiscal lifetime cost of receiving refugees|This study estimates the fiscal consequences of receiving refugees, over the refugees’ lifetime. It uses data from Sweden in 2015, and the calculations account for refugees’ age, years since immigration, and country of origin. The estimated average annual fiscal net contribution over the lifetime of the average refugee (58 years) ranges from –12 per cent of GDP per capita for refugees from the countries of origin for which labor market performance has historically been the strongest, to –22 per cent for those for which it has been the weakest. The estimates imply that if the European Union received all refugees currently in Asia and Africa, the implied average annual fiscal cost over the same time span would be at most 0.6 per cent of GDP.
H50|Disability and Distress: The Effect of Disability Programs on Financial Outcomes|We provide the first evidence on the relationship between disability programs and markers of financial distress: bankruptcy, foreclosure, eviction, and home sale. Rates of these adverse financial events peak around the time of disability application and subsequently fall for both allowed and denied applicants. To estimate the causal effect of disability programs on these outcomes, we use variation induced by an age-based eligibility rule and find that disability allowance substantially reduces the likelihood of adverse financial events. Within three years of the decision, the likelihood of bankruptcy falls by 0.81 percentage point (30 percent), and the likelihood of foreclosure and home sale among homeowners falls by 1.7 percentage points (30 percent) and 2.5 percentage points (20 percent), respectively. We find suggestive evidence of reductions in eviction rates. Conversely, the likelihood of home purchases increases by 0.86 percentage point (20 percent) within three years. We present evidence that these changes reflect true reductions in financial distress. In our model of optimal disability benefits, considering these extreme events increases optimal disability benefits and potentially shortens waiting times.
H50|Will the Polish pension system go bankrupt?|How will the rapid ageing of the population affect pension expenditure in Poland? Jakub Sawulski, Iga Magda and Piotr Lewandowski show that pension expenditure will remain at a level similar to now until 2060. The most important factor preventing an increase in pension expenditure will be a drop in the level of pension benefits. The average replacement rate (the ratio between a person’s first pension and their last salary) will fall by more than double in Poland, which will be the largest fall among all EU countries.
H50|What Explains the Volatility of India's Catch-up Growth?|Indian post reform growth rates have been higher but more volatile compared to transition periods forother comparable countries. The reasons are aggravation of shocks due to unaddressed criticalbottlenecks together with pro-cyclical macroeconomic policy that compressed aggregate demand.Reform is required to relieve constraints, but traditional reforms may be neither appropriate norachievable. Feasible reforms are discussed. Since diversity and resilience has increased and someconstraints have eased, the paper argues sustained high growth is reachable with the relevant policy support.
H50|Size matters? Impact evaluation of business development grants on SME performance|Many international organisations emphasize the need of public grant schemes evaluations. An evaluation provides the opportunity to assess the socio-economic impact achieved by the grant and allows for a refinement of such policy instruments in order to make public funding more effective in achieving the objectives. In this paper, we investigate the effects of a business development grant scheme. More specifically we question whether firmsâ€™ performance measures increased after participating in this grant scheme. Methodically, we match grant receiving firms with grant non-receivers and estimate the average treatment effect on the treated using a two way fixed effects regression. Our results point towards a positive effect of the grant scheme, which is particularly evident for firms of smaller size. Our estimated dose-response functions show that the share of grant amount in firm profits needs to be high enough for the grants to be effective. According to back-of-the envelope analysis, benefits outweigh the direct scheme costs.
H50|How “big” should government be?|We assess how “big” government should reasonably be in a number of advanced countries. First, we will link the recent findings of Data Envelope Analysis on efficient public expenditure with the question of the size of the government. Second, we report descriptive analysis of various government performance indicators in relation to public expenditure to provide indications of overall “optimal” across spending categories. In principle, the highest savings potential is in the biggest expenditure categories, public consumption and social expenditure.
H50|Taxation and Public Spending Efficiency: An International Comparison|This paper evaluates the relevance of the taxation for public spending efficiency in a sample of OECD economies in the period 2003-2017. First, we compute the data envelopment analysis (DEA) scores and the Malmquist productivity index to measure the change in total factor productivity, the change in efficiency and the change in technology. Second, we explain these newly computed public efficiency scores with tax structures using a reduced-form panel data regression specification. Looking at the period between 2007 and 2017, our main findings are as follows: inputs could be theoretically lower by approximately 32-34%; the Malmquist indices show an overall decrease in technology and in TFP. Crucial for policymaking, we find that expenditure efficiency is negatively associated with taxation, more specifically direct and indirect taxes negatively affect government efficiency performance, and the same is true for social security contributions.
H50|On the Cyclicality of Social Expenditure: New Time-Varying evidence from Developing Economies|This paper provides a novel dataset of time-varying measures of social spending cyclicality for an unbalanced panel of 45 developing economies from 1982 to 2012. More specifically, we focus on four categories of government social expenditure: health, social protection, pensions and education. We find that social spending has generally been acyclical over time in developing countries, with the exception of spending on pensions.However, sample averages high marked heterogeneity across countries with the majority showing procyclical behaviour in different social spending categories. In addition,by means of weighted least squares panel regressions with country and time effects, we find that the degree of social spending [pro]cyclicality is generally negatively associated with financial deepening, the level of economic development, trade openness, government size as well as political constraints on the executive.
H50|Returns to Investment in Education: The Case of Turkey|This paper estimates private and social returns to investment in education in Turkey, using the 2017 Household Labor Force Survey and alternative methodologies. The analysis uses the 1997 education reform of increasing compulsory education by three years as an instrument. This results in a private rate of return on the order of 16 percent for higher education and a social return of 10 percent. Using the number of children younger than age 15 in the household as an exclusion restriction, the analysis finds that returns to education for females are higher than those for males. Contrary to many findings in other countries, private returns to those working in the public sector are higher than those in the private sector, and private returns to those who followed the vocational track in secondary education are higher than those in the general academic track. The paper discusses the policy implications of the findings.
H50|Euro Area Government Bond Yield and Liquidity Dependence during different Monetary Policy Accommodation Phases|In this paper, we analyze the relationship between various risk factors and euro area government bond yield spreads, focusing particularly on the monetary policy stance. Our results show that credit and common risk factors are consistently priced in government bond yield spreads, while liquidity differentials are relevant especially during periods of stressed market conditions. We demonstrate that the liquidity component has been more prominent during periods of declining interest rates and increasing reserves, while it has diminished on announcement days of monetary policy decisions related to PSPP. Overall, the liquidity component has been statistically insignificant since the announcement of accommodative non-standard monetary policy measures.
H50|Preparing for the next MFF: Where did the money go in the past?|This paper presents the state of play of the preparations for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) of the EU for the period 2021-2027. It then turns to an analysis of the allocation of regional support funding over the last two MFFs, using a standard growth model to interpret the results. It finds that: First, the distribution of Cohesion spending across regions (as proportion of regional GDP) can be explained to a large extent by a few variables, namely income per capita, unemployment and the importance of agriculture. However, there are also important differences across different clusters of regions. Regions in Southern Europe received less funding than those in Central and Eastern Europe even accounting for differences in these determinants. Second, regions in Southern Europe have a relatively high capital/output ratio and thus a lower productivity of capital. Moreover, their investment rates do not seem to be affected by the Structural Funds they receive. These results suggest the need for a change in emphasis from infrastructure investment to measures that improve overall allocation of resources.
H50|The Impact of Fiscal Policy on Income Distribution in Tanzania: A Computable General Equilibrium Analysis|The Tanzanian government has established a goal to transform the country into a middle-income and semi-industrialized state by 2025. To promote this transformation, the government exempted the Value Added Tax on capital commodities in FY 2017-2018 as a way to promote utilization of these commodities by manufacturing industries and generate growth, employment, and increased incomes. This study analyzes the impact of a reduction in Value Added Tax on capital commodities (electricity, vehicles, machinery, and equipment) under two different closure rules: (1) fixed governmental expenditures and flexible governmental savings (2) flexible governmental expenditures and fixed governmental savings. Under the first regime, government savings declined and industries that depended heavily on government investments suffered. In the second, output increased for all industrial sectors, leading to a decrease in average unemployment. Real consumption increased for all but the richest household categories.
H50|Grande Guerra e Guerra Colonial: Quanto Custaram aos Cofres Portugueses?|A Grande Guerra (1914-1918) e a Guerra Colonial (1961-1974) foram, sem dúvida, os dois conflitos bélicos mais importantes para Portugal no seu passado recente, tendo a sua despesa militar atingido valores recorde durante esses acontecimentos. De acordo com as estimativas apresentadas no presente estudo, o Estado português terá despendido com estas guerras - a preços de hoje, e na moeda actual -, 26,5 mil milhões de euros. Deste montante, 82% terá sido gasto com a Guerra Colonial e 18% com a Grande Guerra. Ao se disponibilizarem pela primeira vez valores concretos sobre os custos dos dois principais conflitos militares em que Portugal se envolveu no século XX, espera-se oferecer um valioso contributo à História Contemporânea de Portugal e estimular outros trabalhos de investigação sobre estes temas.
H50|Disability and Distress: The Effect of Disability Programs on Financial Outcomes|We provide the first evidence on the relationship between disability programs and markers of financial distress: bankruptcy, foreclosure, eviction, and home sale. Rates of these adverse financial events peak around the time of disability application and subsequently fall for both allowed and denied applicants. To estimate the causal effect of disability programs on these outcomes, we use variation induced by an age-based eligibility rule and find that disability allowance substantially reduces the likelihood of ad- verse financial events. Within three years of the decision, the likelihood of bankruptcy falls by 0.81 percentage point (30 percent), and the likelihood of foreclosure and home sale among homeowners falls by 1.7 percentage points (30 percent) and 2.5 percentage points (20 percent), respectively. We find suggestive evidence of reductions in eviction rates. Conversely, the likelihood of home purchases increases by 0.86 percentage point (20 percent) within three years. We present evidence that these changes reflect true reductions in financial distress. Considering these extreme events increases the optimal disability benefit amount and suggests a shorter optimal waiting time.
H50|Police spending and economic stabilization in a monetary economy with crime and differential human capital|This paper presents a dynamic model with crime, differential human capital, credit market imperfection, and police spending to examine the role of the latter in stabilizing shock arisen from formal educational quality uncertainty. Based on a stylized parameterization, we find formal and illegal human capital accumulation to share a common cyclical property. There is a case for the use of a rule-based approach to police spending as it smoothens out the fluctuations arisen from formal educational uncertainty, while contributing to a decoupling of the two types of human capital. This nonetheless comes with a cost of greater propagation of the financial accelerator effect due to credit market imperfection, and therefore necessitates the use of a supplementary monetary smoothing regime to negate these negative effects.
H50|Practising Subnational Public Finance in an Emerging Economy: Fiscal Marksmanship in Kerala|Abstract Our paper analyses the subnational public finance practices in one of the States in India –Kerala- and estimate the fiscal marksmanship. Fiscal marksmanship is the analysis of fiscal forecasting errors. Kerala, though well known for its achievements in human development outcomes, is facing fiscal stress within the rule-based fiscal framework and innovating policy tools to achieve a revenue-led fiscal consolidation. We have examined the Budget Estimates, Revised Estimates and Actuals for the macro-fiscal variables from the Kerala State Budgets, during the period 2011-12 to 2016-17 to analyse the significant deviation between the projections and realizations of the State finances. We found that the magnitude of forecasting errors was relatively significant in case of tax revenue. While partitioning the sources of errors in the budgetary forecasting in Kerala, we found that the random components of the error were larger than the systematic components for all the macro-fiscal variables, except for own revenue, grants and capital expenditure. This has three macro policy implications. One, the volatility in intergovernmental fiscal transfers can affect the stability of finances at subnational level. Two, the State needs to identify innovative policy tools in Additional Resource Mobilisation (ARM) to maintain the human development achievements. Three, within the rule-based fiscal framework, State has to innovate financing strategies for strengthening growth-inducing capital infrastructure formation.
H50|Runoff vs. Plurality: Does It Matter for Expenditures? Evidence from Italy|This paper compares the runoff system and the plurality rule in terms of the size and composition of public expenditures. I use the change in the voting rule in Italian municipalities at 15,000 residents to implement a regression discontinuity design. The results show that municipalities under the runoff system spend at least 20 percent more than those under the plurality rule, and that this effect is primarily driven by a large increase in administrative spending. Additionally, the greater number of candidates and the larger coalitions indicate lower accountability under the runoff system than under the plurality rule.
H50|Re-theorizing the welfare state and the political economy of neoliberalism's war against it|This paper argues neoliberalism is engaged in a war against the welfare state. At issue are competing views regarding the size of the welfare state and how it should be organized. In waging this war, neoliberalism seeks to politically discredit the traditional welfare state and change the economic structure so that the latter becomes unviable. The paper presents a new theoretical framework that distinguishes between modes of production and financing of the welfare estate. Neoliberalism's war rests on ideologically grounded criticisms drawn from mainstream economics; implementation of policies that undermine social solidarity toward the welfare state; exploiting pressures fostered by neoliberal globalization; and misrepresentations about affordability. The welfare state was critical in saving capitalism from itself after World War II. It is a way of embedding the market system so as to produce socially acceptable outcomes that are politically stable. Neoliberalism's war promises a body blow against shared prosperity. More ominously, it may so dis-embed the market system as to recreate conditions Polyani (1944) blamed for the rise of fascism in the 1930s.
H50|Government Spending during Sudden Stop Crises|This paper studies the effect of government spending policy during sudden stop crises. Using a quarterly dataset of 30 small open economies, I find that government spending is more effective in stimulating consumption and appreciating the real exchange rate during sudden stops than during normal times. To rationalize this, I build a two-sector model with a collateral constraint on external debt. During a recession, an adverse international shock reduces consumption and undermines the value of collateral. The collapsing asset price in turn tightens the financial constraint, deteriorates the real absorption, and sets-in a fully-blown debt-deflation mechanism. In this context, an increase in government purchases exerts a counteracting force by raising asset prices and stimulating real activities. More importantly, if the government can commit to certain paths of spending in the future, the expected real appreciation will further relax the financial constraint today. I use a calibrated model to explore the multiplier effect under different exchange rate regimes, the asymmetric multipliers, and the multipliers under different levels of shock persistence.
H50|L'opus di Mauro Fasiani|Scopo di questo lavoro non è quello di discutere il pensiero scientifico di Fasiani, ma solo di attirare l'attenzione degli studiosi facendo conoscere il contenuto dei suoi apporti scientifici, perché Mauro Fasiani non sembra occupare ancora il posto che merita nell'ambito scientifico. In questo lavoro viene quindi presentato un profilo biografico di Mauro Fasiani, seguito da una breve analisi dei suoi scritti scientifici disposta secondo i principali filoni delle sue ricerche. Segue una bibliografia delle sue opere e la bibliografia degli scritti riguardanti il suo apporto scientifico.

H50|The Policy Mix in the US and EMU: Evidence from a SVAR Analysis|We use a SVAR approach to the effects of fiscal and monetary policies, as well as their interactions (policy mix) for the US and the Euro Area (EMU). Overall, our results show that these two cases are different from each other. First, while in the case of the US there is evidence of Keynesian monetary policy, the same is not true in the case of the EMU. Second, considering the effects of the global economic and financial crisis, there is evidence of non-Keynesian fiscal policy in the case of the EMU (expansionary fiscal consolidation), while it does not hold in the case of the US. Third, there is evidence supporting the traditional inverse relationship between monetary policy interest rates and inflation in the case of the US, whereas in the case of the EMU there is a price puzzle (frequent in SVAR studies). Fourth, the baseline model seems to be robust in the case of the US, when considering the effects of the economic and financial crisis 2007-2009, while the opposite holds in the case of the EMU. However, in both cases, the policies seem to act as complements. Another similarity appears when analysing the relationship between public spending and taxation, where there is evidence supporting a fiscal retrenchment.
H50|Tax morale and the role of social norms and reciprocity - Evidence from a randomized survey experiment|We present the first randomized survey experiment in the context of tax compliance to assess the role of social norms and reciprocity for intrinsic tax morale. We find that participants in a reciprocity treatment have significantly higher tax morale than those in a social-norm treatment. This suggests that a potential backfire effect of social norms is outweighed if the consequences of violating the social norm are made salient. We further document the anatomy of intrinsic motivations for tax compliance and present first evidence that previously found gender effects in tax morale are not driven by differences in risk preferences.
H50|The ECB’s fiscal policy|Abstract While the ECB helped mitigate the euro crisis in the aftermath of Lehman, it has stretched its monetary mandate and moved into fiscal territory. This text describes and summarizes the crucial role played by the ECB in the intervention spiral resulting from its bid to manage the crisis. It also outlines ongoing competitiveness problems in southern Europe, discusses the so-called austerity policy of the Troika, comments on QE and presents two alternative paths for the future development of Europe.
H50|Has Fiscal Rule changed the Fiscal Marksmanship of Union Government?|We analyse the fiscal marksmanship of the macro-fiscal variables of Union Government ex-ante and ex-post to the formulation of fiscal rules in India. The fiscal marksmanship is the accuracy of budgetary forecasting. The fiscal rules have been legally mandated in India in the form of fiscal responsibility and budget management Act (FRBM Act) in 2003, with a criteria of fiscal-deficit to GDP threshold ratio of 3 per cent and gradual phasing out of revenue deficit. Using Theil's inequality coefficient (U) based on the mean square prediction error, the paper estimates the magnitude of errors in the budgetary forecasts in India during the period ex-ante and ex-post to fiscal rules, and also decomposed the errors into biasedness, unequal variation and random components. The decomposition of errors is to analyze the source of error in both the regimes. Our results found that in both regimes, the proportion of error due to random variation has been significantly higher, which is beyond the control of the forecaster. In other words, the error due to bias of the policy maker in preparing the Union Budget has been negligible in the period ex-ante and ex-post to fiscal responsibility and budget management (FRBM) Act in India. This result has significant policy implications especially in the context of repeal of 2003 FRBM Act in India and the Union Government has announced clauses for a `New FRBM Act' in India in the Finance Bill 2018.
H50|Living Standards Analysis Model: The First Prototype|How do we understand the synergies and trade-offs of a given policy on area beyond that policy, such as the effect of housing on health and on income? How do we choose between policies in completely different areas, such as an education policy and a health policy? Treasury’s Living Standards Framework provides one possible starting point, but it provides little assistance tracing the many dependencies between policy areas. A model that includes those dependencies could help. The Living Standards Analysis Model (LSAM) is designed to do this. A first prototype of the model has just been developed. This model includes all eleven aspects of wellbeing as described by the OECD’s How’s Life? framework and linkages between the different aspects for a small open economy. Most models for studying wellbeing only include one or two aspects, missing the rich set of interactions that can occur with greater coverage. As an early prototype, this version of the model does have many flaws and requires significant further development, but it forms a basis for creating an improved model as well as providing some qualitatively useful results. The model is loosely based on a stocks-and-flows type of model, with a small general equilibrium model covering the market economy part of the model. This paper is focussed on the description of the model.
H50|Analyse de l’impact des politiques fiscales et de protection sociale sur les inégalités et la pauvreté au Togo|Le gouvernement togolais a entrepris des réformes importantes après la crise des années 90 dans le but d’améliorer les conditions de vie de la population grâce à des politiques publiques adaptées, notamment à travers la Stratégie de croissance accélérée et de promotion de l’emploi (SCAPE) 2013-17. Malgré des améliorations du niveau d’éducation et une augmentation de l’espérance de vie, les défis en termes de pauvreté et d’inégalités restent très importants. Cette étude estime l’impact redistributif des revenus fiscaux (les impôts) et des dépenses fiscales à travers les transferts monétaires, non monétaires, et les subventions, sur les revenus des ménages et les inégalités. Deux conclusions ressortent de cette analyse : la politique fiscale réduit les inégalités au Togo, mais appauvrit les ménages les plus pauvres.
H50|The deterioration of the public spending mix during the global financial crisis: Insights from new indicators|New indicators measuring the effects of public spending on inclusive growth have been constructed using recent empirical work by Fournier and Johansson (2016) and a recent public finance dataset (Bloch et al., 2016). A first set of indicators combines information on the mix of public spending. Each spending item share is multiplied with an estimated coefficient from growth and inequality equations to build both a growth and an income distribution component, which is then summed up to an aggregate inclusive growth indicator. The spending mix analysis cannot, however, measure the effectiveness of public spending within individual spending items, which is difficult to observe in a comparable manner across countries. A second set of indicators attempts to at least partly overcome this limitation by including information on the size and perceived effectiveness of governments. The average of the spending mix indicator and the size and effectiveness indicator provides an indicative overall indicator on the effects of public spending on inclusive growth. The analysis suggests that countries with a counter-cyclical fiscal stance typically have a public spending structure that is more supportive of inclusive growth. There is also a striking link between the growth component of the public spending mix indicator and the output gap: the capacity of the public finances to support inclusive growth deteriorated markedly in the countries hardest hit during the recent crisis.
H50|Costa Rica: Restoring fiscal sustainability and setting the basis for a more growth-friendly and inclusive fiscal policy|Consecutive years of primary deficits have led to mounting public debt of almost 50% of GDP, one of the fastest increases in Latin America over the last decade. Government attempts to restore fiscal health have been undermined by a gridlocked Congress. While only minor reforms have been enacted to contain spending, efforts to curb tax evasion and increase the efficiency of the tax administration are commendable. However, increases in tax revenue have been unable to match mandated increases in spending. As a consequence, sovereign debt ratings have declined to below investment level, and the negative outlook on Costa Rica’s debt signals increasing financing costs. Against this backdrop, the risk of a fiscal crisis is increasing, particularly as global financial conditions become less favourable and debt structure has shifted towards increased reliance on floating rates and dollar-denominated bonds. Enacting a three year fiscal consolidation programme of one percentage point of GDP each year, will enable debt to stabilise at current levels by 2032. The current draft bill to strengthen public finances – Ley de Fortalecimiento de las Finanzas Públicas – proposes a comprehensive fiscal reform package, with measures on both the revenue and the spending side, as well as a fiscal rule. It needs to be complemented with additional measures to contain revenue earmarking. In addition, reducing excessive fragmentation of the public sector would allow the Ministry of Finance to regain control of the budget. There is also room to reduce expenditure on remuneration of public sector workers, one of the fastest growing expenditure items and a source of income inequality. The proposed fiscal rule should be strengthened, including introducing a multi-year expenditure framework and a fiscal council. Debt management should be modernised by stepping up communication with markets and reducing the number of benchmark securities. Over time, improving social spending efficiency and quality as well as modifying the tax structure away from social security contributions and enlarging the tax base would allow for a much stronger contribution of fiscal policy to growth and equity.
H50|How does the state destroy incentives in innovation financing?|We investigate the effect of state subsidy on the behavior of entrepreneur and venture capitalist in a double moral hazard and fixed investment model under positive externalities. We infer that investment subsidy and success fee improve the incentives, ease credit rationing, hence boost private financing, which explains the popularity of hybrid venture capital systems. The main disadvantage of these systems is, however, that the entrepreneur is encouraged to minimize his/her own capital investment and to ask for the maximal state subsidy available. It may happen that public sources go to entrepreneurs capable to finance their projects privately, so state subsidies increase state deficit (and private profits) without any effects on public welfare leaving other important areas underfinanced. We also prove that state guarantee definitely creates perverse incentives, hence it is not recommended in our model.
H50|Reforming Fiscal Institutions in Resource-Rich Arab Economies: Policy Proposals|This paper traces the evolution of fiscal institutions of Resource Rich Arab Economies (RRAEs) over time since their pre-oil days, through the discovery of oil to their build-up of oil exports. It then identifies challenges faced by RRAEs and variations in their severity among the different countries over time. Finally, it articulates specific policy reforms, which, if implemented successfully, could help to overcome these challenges. In some cases, however, these policy proposals may give rise to important trade-offs that will have to be evaluated carefully in individual cases.
H50|Enhanced Fiscal Integration in the EMU? Proceedings of the joint workshop, organised by the European Commission, the European Stability Mechanism and the German Council of Economic Experts on 19 September 2017|This volume presents the proceedings of the workshop organised by the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs (ECFIN) jointly with the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the German Council of Economic Experts (GCEE) on 19 September 2017 in Brussels. The workshop aimed at raising awareness about the fiscal policy architecture in Europe and its potential future developments and contributing to the expert debate on these issues. It consisted of two sessions with two panels each. Short presentations of expert or research contributions were followed by a debate with the audience. The first session was devoted to a review of the European experience with fiscal policy coordination and governance, including perspectives on the euro area fiscal stance. The second session focused on fiscal risk sharing and stabilisation in the euro area. It explored different options of a fiscal stabilisation function and their design.
H50|Political viability of intergenerational transfers. An empirical application|Public intergenerational transfers (IGTs) may arise because of the failure of private arrangements to provide optimal economic resources for the young and the old. We examine the political sustainability of the system of public IGTs by asking what the outcome would be if the decision per se to reallocate economic resources between generations was put to the vote. By exploiting the particular nature of National Transfer Accounts data – transfers for pensions and education and total public transfers – and the political economy application proposed by Rangel (2003) we show that most developed countries would vote in favor of a joint public education and pension system. Moreover, our results indicate that a system of total public IGTs to the young and elderly would attract substantial political support and, hence, would be politically viable for most countries in the sample.
H50|Decentralization and Football|Objectives We show that decentralization of economic and political power makes a substantial difference in football. Decentralization increases the competitive balance of domestic football leagues and creates an advantage for clubs from decentralized countries in international competitions. Methods We run pooled cross‐sectional time‐series analyses using data from 35 European countries over the period 1950–2010 and logistic regressions with data from the first 18 editions of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League. Results We find that regional autonomy boosts the competition among clubs from different regions and results in a greater competitive balance of domestic football leagues. Clubs from decentralized countries have a greater chance of winning, or at least playing in the final, than those from centralized countries. Conclusions The degree of countries’ political and economic decentralization positively increases the likelihood of winning football international trophies.
H50|Private Sector Policymaking|Candidates often tout their private sector experience when running for public office. But do businessperson politicians actually govern differently? This paper argues that given their preferences and managerial expertise, businesspeople in office will adopt policies favorable to the business community and improve government efficiency. To test these claims, I collect data on over 33,000 Russian mayors and legislators and investigate policy outcomes using detailed municipal budgets and over a million procurement contracts. Using a regression discontinuity design, I find that businessperson politicians increase expenditures on roads and transport, while leaving health and education spending untouched. Prioritizing economic over social infrastructure brings immediate benefits to firms, while holding back long-term accumulation of human capital. However, businesspeople do not reduce budget deficits, but rather adopt less competitive methods for selecting contractors, particularly in corruption-ripe construction. In all, businessperson politicians do more to make government run for business, rather than like a business.
H50|Is Shale Gas a Good Bridge to Renewables? An Application to Europe|Abstract This paper explores whether climate policy justifies developing more shale gas and addresses the question of a potential arbitrage between shale gas development and the transition to clean energy. We construct a Hotelling-like model where electricity may be produced by three perfectly substitutable sources: an abundant dirty resource (coal), a non-renewable less polluting resource (shale gas), and an abundant clean resource (solar). The resources differ by their carbon contents and their unit costs. Shale gas extraction’s technology (fracking) generates local damages. Fixed costs must be paid to develop shale gas and to deploy the clean resource on a large scale. Climate policy takes the form of a carbon budget. We show that, at the optimum, a more stringent climate policy does not always go together with an increase of the quantity of shale gas extracted, and that banning shale gas extraction most often leads to bring forward the development of the clean resource, but not always. We calibrate the model for Europe in order to determine whether shale gas should be extracted and in which amount, and to evaluate the effects of a moratorium on shale gas use.
H50|A multi-country analysis of austerity policies in the European Union|In this paper, we analyse the global effects, i.e., the effects on the world economy, from the austerity policies implemented in the European Union (EU) over the last years. Specifically, we simulate the effects of three alternative policies aimed to get a fall of one percentage point in the EU’s government deficit to GDP ratio, through a decrease in the level of public spending, and increases in consumption and in labour taxes. We examine their effects on the main macroeconomic variables of seven regions of the world economy, i.e., the EU, the US, Japan, China, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Rest of the World. The empirical methodology makes use of a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, through an extension of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model. The three policy measures led to contractionary effects on the EU’s levels of activity, which were accompanied with changes in income distribution, always detrimental to labour. The effects on the rest of the world, however, were mostly negligible.
H50|Previsión de la carga de intereses de las Administraciones Públicas|This document presents a tool, available at the Banco de España, for forecasting General government interest payments in Spain. Contrary to some models, which are very detailed and take into account the specific characteristics and dates of every individual debt instrument issued by the government, the tool presented here aggregates as much as possible, for simplicity reasons, but without losing forecasting capacity, as it is shown in the document. Also, the explanatory variables and the accounting approach used are chosen to be consistent with the regular macroeconomic projection exercises of the Banco de España, of which they are part.
H50|Is there strength in unity? Some preliminary evidence on inter-municipal cooperation in Italy|This paper focuses on municipal unions, the most structured form of inter-municipal cooperation in Italy. Using information from multiple sources, we have built up an administrative database covering more than 500 municipal unions over the period 1998-2015. By cross-checking the information on the municipalities participating in each union with the figures from their financial statements, we have been able to follow the trend in their expenditure both before and after joining the union, acknowledging that time is needed for the effects of the cooperation to manifest themselves. We have replicated this analysis for single municipal functions in order to detect potential heterogeneity in the resulting economies of scale. The results show that belonging to a union has led to a reduction in expenditure only for some municipal functions (such as general administration, local police, roads and traffic) and over a certain time period. The main contribution of our work is that we have studied the effects of inter-municipal cooperation from a temporal perspective largely unexplored in previous studies of the Italian case.
H50|Fiscal Multipliers in Russia|The paper covers theoretical and practical issues related to estimation of fiscal multipliers for the Russian economy that measure the response of output to the discretionary change in fiscal indicators. Analysis of the main determinants affecting the size of multipliers suggests relatively low values of fiscal multipliers in Russia. By means of a Structural Bayesian Autoregressive Model we obtain the multiplier for the overall government revenue and spending equal to -0,75 and 0,28 correspondingly, i.e. an increase in government revenue (spending) by 1 per cent of GDP leads to a decrease (increase) in output by 0,75 (0,28) per cent. In the case of government spending shock the maximum effect on output is in the subsequent quarter after the shock, while in the case of revenue shock the effect builds up quarter by quarter and reaches its peak in the eighth quarter. The results obtained are generally in line with the expectations as well as with the results available for the emerging market economies. Fiscal consolidation scheduled for the medium-term is expected to have negative impact on the output growth. However, since it is intended to be carried out mainly at the expense of the expenditure part of the budget, this should be less harmful for economic growth and could promote the efficiency of public spending.

Depot-level maintenance is essential to ensuring an aircraftâ€™s capability to perform missions and can influence whether an aircraftâ€™s life can be extended cost-effectively. This report focuses on depot-level maintenance practices for the Air Forceâ€™s and Navyâ€™s combat aircraft as sources of insights for the new F-35 fighter aircraft.
H50|The Distribution of Household Income, 2014|In 2014, average household income before accounting for means-tested transfers and federal taxes was $19,000 for the lowest income quintile (fifth) and $281,000 for the highest quintile. Those transfers and taxes increased average household incomes toward the bottom of the income distribution and reduced incomes toward the top of the distribution. After accounting for the effects of transfers and taxes, average household income for the lowest and highest quintiles was $31,000 and $207,000, respectively, CBO estimates.
H50|An Analysis of the Presidentâ€™s 2019 Budget|The cumulative deficit under the Presidentâ€™s policies would total $9.5 trillion over the 2019â€“2028 period, $2.9 trillion less than in CBO's baseline. Over that period, the deficit would range from 3.2 percent to 4.5 percent of GDP, averaging 3.7 percent. As a result, federal debt held by the public would increase from 78 percent of GDP this year to 86 percent in 2028.
H50|The 2018 Long-Term Budget Outlook|In CBOâ€™s projections, federal budget deficits grow substantially over the next several years in relation to the size of the economy, stabilize for a few years, and then grow again over the rest of the 30-year period. If current laws generally remained unchanged, the growing deficits would raise federal debt held by the public from 78 percent of gross domestic product this year to nearly 100 percent by the end of the next decade and 152 percent by 2048.
H50|Measuring the Costs of Federal Insurance Programs: Cash or Accrual?|Following on a January 2018 report about using cash or accrual measures in federal budgeting, CBO assesses the advantages and disadvantages of those measures for federal insurance programs, including deposit insurance, flood insurance, and pension insurance. The report also describes a range of options for the expanding the use of accrual measures in the budget process.
H50|Fair-Value Estimates of the Cost of Federal Credit Programs in 2019|The federal government supports some private activities by providing credit assistance to individuals and businesses. CBO offers two kinds of measures for estimating the lifetime costs incurred by those federal credit programs: estimates created by following procedures prescribed by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA); and estimates that account for the market value of the governmentâ€™s obligations, which are called fair-value estimates. Using FCRA procedures, CBO estimates that new loans and loan guarantees issued in 2019 would result in savings of $37.4 billion.
H50|The Deficit Reductions Necessary to Meet Various Targets for Federal Debt|CBO has examined various illustrative scenarios in which the federal government makes debt held by the public smaller than it would be if current laws remained generally unchanged. In those scenarios, the primary deficitâ€”that is, the deficit excluding net outlays for interestâ€”is reduced to make debt equal 41 percent, 78 percent, or 100 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) over the next 15 to 30 years. Two broad strategies are used: reducing the primary deficit by a constant share of GDP over time and reducing the primary deficit by an increasing share of GDP.
H50|CBOâ€™s Projections of Federal Receipts and Expenditures in the National Income and Product Accounts|Federal receipts and expenditures in the national income and product accounts (NIPAs) differ in certain ways from revenues and outlays as shown in the federal budget. This report presents CBOâ€™s baseline projections using the NIPA framework.
H50|An Update to the Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028|In CBOâ€™s updated projections, real gross domestic product (GDP) grows by 3.1 percent in 2018 and 2.4 percent in 2019. In both years, growth in actual GDP outpaces growth in potential (that is, maximum sustainable) GDP, creating excess demand in the economy and further lowering the unemployment rate.
H50|The Long-Term Budget Outlook Under Alternative Scenarios for Fiscal Policy|In CBOâ€™s most recent extended baseline projections, federal debt held by the public rises from an amount equal to 78 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018 to 118 percent of GDP in 2038. This report expands on those projections by showing how the federal budget and the nationâ€™s economy would evolve under three alternative scenarios. In those scenarios, laws would be changed to continue certain policies now in place, leading to even higher debt.
H50|The Distribution of Household Income, 2015|In 2015, average household income before accounting for means-tested transfers and federal taxes was $20,000 for the lowest income quintile (fifth) and $292,000 for the highest quintile. Those transfers and taxes increased average household income toward the bottom of the income distribution and reduced income toward the top of the distribution. After accounting for the effects of transfers and taxes, average household income for the lowest and highest quintiles was $33,000 and $215,000, respectively, CBO estimates.
H50|A Review of CBOâ€™s Estimate of the Effects of the Recovery Act on SNAP|CBO estimated in February 2009 that spending under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits would total $19 billion from 2009 to 2013. Actual outlays were $22 billion more than that amount. This report explains CBOâ€™s calculations, identifies factors that contributed to the underestimate, and examines factors affecting ARRA-related spending on SNAP for 2014 to 2019.
H50|R&D-driven medical progess, health care costs, and the future of human longevity|In this paper we set up an overlapping generations model of gerontological founded human aging that takes the interaction between R&D-driven medical progress and access to health care into account. We use the model to explore potential futures of human health and longevity. For the baseline policy scenario of health care access, the calibrated model predicts substantial future increases in health and life expectancy, associated with rising shares of health expenditure in GDP. Freezing the expenditure share at the 2020 level by rationing access to health care severely reduces potential gains in health, longevity and welfare. These losses are greatest in the long run due to reduced incentives for medical R&D. For example, rationing is predicted to reduce potential gains of life-expectancy at age 65 by about 4 years in the year 2050. Generally, and perhaps surprisingly, young individuals (i.e. those who save the most health care contributions through rationing) are predicted to suffer the greatest losses in terms of life expectancy and welfare.
H50|The Role of Government and Trust in the Market Economy|This paper studies the role of governments and its link to trust. We argue that the public’s trust strongly depends on governments delivering on their core tasks in a market economy. In some economies, a neglect of core tasks can be observed and there seems to be some erosion, notably in terms of securing sound rules of the game in industrialised countries. We find very little correlation between government expenditure and trust but a strong correlation with delivering on core tasks. This leads us to conclude that it is not government spending per se that needs to increase to build trust, but rather better focused government activities.
H50|Uncertain Altruism and Non-Linear Long-Term Care Policies|We study the design of public long-term care (LTC) insurance when the altruism of informal caregivers is uncertain. We consider non-linear policies where the LTC benefit depends on the level of informal care, which is assumed to be observable while children's altruism is not. The traditional topping up and opting out policies are special cases of ours. Both total and informal care should increase with the children's level of altruism. This obtains under full and asymmetric information. Social LTC, on the other hand, may be non-monotonic. Under asymmetric information, social LTC is lower than its full information level for the lowest level of altruism, while it is distorted upward for the higher level of altruism. This is explained by the need to provide incentives to high-altruism children. The implementing contract is always such that social care increases with formal care.
H50|Did Austerity Cause Brexit?|Did austerity cause Brexit? This paper shows that the rise of popular support for the UK Independence Party (UKIP), as the single most important correlate of the subsequent Leave vote in the 2016 European Union (EU) referendum, along with broader measures of political dissatisfaction, are strongly and causally associated with an individual’s or an area’s exposure to austerity since 2010. In addition to exploiting data from the population of all electoral contests in the UK since 2000, I leverage detailed individual level panel data allowing me to exploit within-individual variation in exposure to specific welfare reforms as well as broader measures of political preferences. The results suggest that the EU referendum could have resulted in a Remain victory had it not been for a range of austerity-induced welfare reforms. Further, auxiliary results suggest that the welfare reforms activated existing underlying economic grievances that have broader origins than what the current literature on Brexit suggests. Up until 2010, the UK’s welfare state evened out growing income differences across the skill divide through transfer payments.This pattern markedly stops from 2010 onwards as austerity started to bite.
H50|Political Competitiveness and Fiscal Structure: A Time Series Analysis. Canada, 1870 - 2015|We investigate the extent to which the intensity of political competition moderates the governance issues that arise in relation to Canada’s fiscal structure. By fiscal structure we mean three distinct but interrelated fiscal dimensions of the state: financial stability, long run size and short run interventions into the private economy with respect to the business cycle. The paper is distinctive in focusing on four measures of political competitiveness that reflect the degree of competition in and between national parliamentary elections: the size of the majority of the governing party in the House; the distribution of the volatility adjusted winning margins of the governing party; the proportion of electorally marginal constituencies adjusted for asymmetry between parties; and a multiparty measure of the competitiveness of elections at the constituency level. The analysis accounts for the differing time series properties of the political and economic variables and the comingling of long and short term fiscal policies in the time series data. Estimation using a sequence of ARDL models indicates that greater political competition enhances fiscal stability, speeds up convergence of government size from above on fundamentals, and helps to align fiscal deficits better with the business cycle. The potential quantitative impact of more intense electoral competition is analyzed by applying the deficit model to the period of fiscal instability that arose in the 1980’s and early 1990’s.
H50|Who is NOT voting for Brexit anymore?|Using estimates of support for Leave across UK local authority areas constructed from a comprehensive 20,000 strong survey, we show that both the level and the geographic variation capturing differential degrees of support for Leave have changed significantly since the 2016 EU referendum. A lot of area characteristics, many of which were previously associated with higher levels of support for Leave, are now significant correlates capturing a swing towards Remain. They include, for example, the degree to which local authorities receive transfers from the EU or the extent to which their economies rely on trade with the EU, along with past electoral support for UKIP (and the BNP) and exposure to immigration from Eastern Europe. Lastly, exposure to austerity since 2010 is among the strongest individual correlates weakening the support for Leave. The evidence is consistent with the argument that the small margin of victory of Leave in 2016 was, to a significant extent, carried by protest voters, who used the EU referendum to voice their discontent with domestic social and economic developments, particularly, austerity. Lastly, we present some evidence suggesting that the UK public, even in Leave supporting areas, would be much more willing to make compromises on free movement and aspects of single market membership compared to what appears to be the UK governments negotiation objective.

H50|Informe del gasto del gobierno de Colombia en lucha antidrogas 2013 - 2015. Informe final|El objetivo de este documento es responder a la siguiente pregunta: ¿Cuánto gasta el Estado colombiano en la lucha contra las drogas? La respuesta corta es que, excluyendo el gasto en seguridad y defensa, el Estado colombiano gastó en 2015 $970.480 millones de pesos en la lucha contra las drogas. En 2013 esa cifra fue de $1.174.651 millones y en 2014 de $1.140.019 millones. ¿Por qué es relevante responder a esta pregunta? Básicamente por dos razones: la primera es que se trata de un gasto importante, equivalente al 0,5% del gasto general de la Nación. La segunda es que la cifra hace parte del informe de seguimiento que periódicamente se remite al congreso de Estados Unidos y del cual depende en gran medida la aprobación de recursos de cooperación para Colombia.

H50|¿Cómo evaluar y mejorar las políticas de subsidios públicos en la era de la medición del desempeño y la rendición de cuentas por resultados?|El criterio de validación de los subsidios cambió en los últimos treinta años. El enfoque económico de las políticas y los programas que se apoyan en subsidios públicos a los particulares no ha cambiado sustancialmente desde mediados del Siglo pasado. Desde el ángulo de la economía política, la discusión académica sobre los subsidios ha estado dominada por posiciones ideológicas que se remontan a los clásicos de la economía capitalista. El debate ideológico-­?estratégico entre los partidarios más acérrimos del libre mercado y los defensores de la intervención estatal en el comportamiento de la oferta, la demanda y los precios, se reduce en la práctica a una cuestión de grado. En el fondo todos aceptamos un cierto grado de intervencionismo en el mercado, sea mayor, sea menor. Y tirios y troyanos reconocen en los subsidios a precios, ingresos, ahorro, consumo o inversión una palanca legítima de orientación del comportamiento.

H50|El crecimiento del gasto del gobierno en Colombia: Una revisión empírica trimestral desde 1995 hasta 2017 de la hipótesis de Wagner|Con base en los datos trimestrales de Colombia para el período de 1995 a 2017, se busca efectuar una revisión empírica actualizada sobre la relación entre el crecimiento del gasto del gobierno y el crecimiento de la economía colombiana, para probar que el enfoque de la hipótesis de Wagner es válido al explicar el crecimiento del tamaño del gobierno colombiano. Esta revisión empírica se llevará a cabo, a través de la metodología de cointegración presentada en el trabajo de Pesaran, M. H., Shin, Y., y Smith, R. J. (2001), a partir de modelos Autorregresivos de Distribución de Rezagos (ARDL por sus siglas en ingles). Los resultados indican que la hipótesis de Wagner es aceptada, esto implica que la relación positiva entre ambas variables se ha mantenido estable a través de seis periodos presidenciales en Colombia.

La revisión general del gasto asociado a la justicia en las tres dimensiones mencionadas antes tiene como objetivo propiciar el dialogo conjunto y constructivo entre economistas, hacedores de política, jueces y altas cortes.
H50|Comisión del Gasto y la Inversión Pública. Informe final|De acuerdo con lo dispuesto en la Ley de Reforma Tributaria de 2016, en febrero de 2017 se creó la Comisión del Gasto y la Inversión Pública, con el propósito de revisar, entre otros, los programas de subsidios y de asistencia pública, los criterios de priorización de la inversión, las inflexibilidades presupuestales, las rentas de destinación específica, y los efectos sobre la equidad y la eficiencia de las decisiones de gasto, con el objeto de proponer reformas orientadas a fortalecer la equidad, la inclusión productiva, la formalización y la convergencia del desarrollo entre zonas urbanas y rurales, la redistribución del ingreso, la eficiencia de la gestión pública y el fortalecimiento del Estado. La Comisión tuvo un plazo de diez meses a partir de su conformación para allegar al Gobierno Nacional un documento con sus principales análisis y recomendaciones. Este informe consta de diez capítulos que a su vez sirvieron de soporte para sus recomendaciones. En los primeros cinco capítulos se abordan temas transversales como son: las tendencias y perspectivas del gasto público en las últimas décadas, dado el escenario económico y de ingresos previstos; las principales limitaciones del proceso presupuestal, del empleo público, del sistema de compras y contratación públicas y, por último, la carga que, para el presupuesto, se presentan los litigios contra el Estado, acompañado todo de las respectivas recomendaciones en cada tema. En los siguientes cinco capítulos se abordan los temas sectoriales que, a juicio de la Comisión, son de mayor impacto en materia de eficiencia y eficacia del gasto público. En esta parte del documento se analizan y formulan recomendaciones sobre el gasto público en pensiones, salud, educación, defensa y el gasto en subsidios a personas y hogares y al sector productivo. Los nueve comisionados firmantes de este informe participaron a título ad-honorem. Para las labores de la secretaría técnica se contó con la financiación de la Cooperación de la Secretaría de Asuntos Económicos del Gobierno Suizo (SECO) en el marco del proyecto “Fortalecimiento de la Gestión de las Finanzas Públicas”, cuya implementación adelanta AECOM International Development Europe.
H50|Der Wohlfahrtstaat als Grundbestandteil des modernen demokratischen Staatsgefüges<BR>[The welfare state as a basic component of the modern democratic state structure]|Defining the welfare state is not a simpleminded task. Actually, there are numerous definitions which try to reflect at least some of the basic characteristics of the welfare state or its objectives and its functions. For some, there is primarily an institutional parameter, for others there are functional issues which have to be firstly indicated and for others, the ideological and political factors determine the definition and the attitude towards the welfare state. Apart from all these crucial ascertainments, there are some basic fundamental characteristics and values of the welfare state which render it as a precondition of the existence of the modern state. Unquestionably, it reflects a distinct part of the state but most importantly, it comprises a prerequisite for its existence. This is the exact aim of this paper; to surpass the theoretical diversifications and to find the fundamental common ground which forms the indispensability for the existence of the welfare state.
H50|Causalité entre dépenses publiques et croissance économique au Togo<BR>[Causality between Public Expenditures and Economic Growth in Togo]|This study intends to analyse the relationship between public expenditures components and economic growth in Togo. It was about determining if ties of causality exist in the sense of Granger between these components and the economic growth Togo and determine if these ties exist, in what sense they go. We have used world development indicator data relative to Togo from 1980 to 2010. The results of our evaluation indicate that causality doesn’t exist to the sense of Granger between the different public expenditure components and the economic growth in Togo.
H50|The Decommissioning of the Middle Class|": The euro crisis has threatened the balance of social structures, through the impoverishment of the middle class, in almost all countries of the Old Continent. This trend has not only posed a threat to social cohesion, but it also threats the very nature of the so-called Western-style Democracy. The reason for this is that there is a class that has always been a ""cushion"" that absorbs both the vibrations of competition and the confrontation of the social elite with the socially weak, offering the latter the ability to overcome their misery. In most capitalist economies, the middle class label is based on an economic definition that is largely based on a lifestyle that is based on a certain economic robustness and endurance. With the deepening of the crisis, however, the diversity of the middle class not only has it been jeopardized, but rather, it has gradually been replaced by a new demographic category called the prekariat. This new category consists of a group of people once in the middle class and currently marginalized. All of this leads to generalized uncertainty and totally unstable political attitudes, with intense mobility at the extremes. The rapid rise of right and left-wing populism is an aspect of the threatened subjugation of the middle class strata. The consequences for societies when their layered center is lost are obvious and significant."
H50|Do government activities determine electricity consumption in Ghana? An empirical investigation|The paper investigates the long-run relationship between government activities and electricity consumption using annual data collected from world development indicator for a period of 1971 to 2011 in Ghana. The paper adopts the autoregressive distributed lag model of co integration for the estimation. The estimation reveals both short run and long-run relationships between government expenditure and electricity consumption. The findings suggest that government activities explain electricity consumption in Ghana for the period under discussion, and could be considered as a policy variable in the management of electricity consumption.
H50|Examen de l'optimalité de la performance fiscale dans les pays en développement : le cas de l’UEMOA<BR>[Review of the optimality of tax performance in developing countries: evidence from WAEMU]|This article highlights the existence of a non-linear relationship between the tax rate and economic growth in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and determines the threshold at which a high economic activities would result in negative externalities. Using a Scully optimization model, and an alternative quadratic model, and using data covering the period from 1980 to 2016, this study confirms the existence of non-linear effects of taxation on growth and suggests that the tax burden rate that would maximize economic growth in the WAEMU is 21.04% and 23.8% of GDP, respectively. We also estimate the optimal tax burden for the ECOWAS countries - a wider regional economic integration zone to which all WAEMU member countries belong - and we find that the optimal tax rate is 21.5% and 24.2%. Therefore, we retain that the optimal tax pressure rate for WAEMU countries is 24% of GDP. Our results highlight the inability of WAEMU countries to mobilize tax revenues up to the required tax threshold. Based on the results and analyzes, this study recommends taking measures focused on the modernization of tax administrations, such as the introduction of anti-fraud and tax evasion measures, as well as the promotion of fiscal citizenship.
H50|Second Thoughts on Estimating Expansionary Fiscal Policy E ffects in the United States|This paper revisits mixed findings of the expansionary fiscal spending effect in the United States. An array of standard Vector-Autoregressive (VAR) models has been implemented to capture inconsistent effects of the fiscal expansion. Findings in this paper consistently reveal that without considering the influence of transfer payments, state and local government spending, and the timing of sample, measuring the effect of expanded government purchases along would result in an upward bias of the comprehensive fiscal stimulus effect. This paper questions the validity of using government purchases alone to precisely evaluate the effect of fiscal expansion.
H50|Fiscal Consolidation Programs and Income Inequality|Following the Great Recession, many European countries implemented fiscal consolidation policies aimed at reducing government debt. Using three independent data sources and three different empirical approaches, we document a strong positive relationship between higher income inequality and stronger recessive impacts of fiscal consolidation programs across time and place. To explain this finding, we develop a life-cycle, overlapping generations economy with uninsurable labor market risk. We calibrate our model to match key characteristics of a number of European economies, including the distribution of wages and wealth, social security, taxes and debt, and study the effects of fiscal consolidation programs. We find that higher income risk induces precautionary savings behavior, which decreases the proportion of credit-constrained agents in the economy. Credit-constrained agents have less elastic labor supply responses to fiscal consolidation achieved through either tax hikes or public spending cuts, and this explains the relationship between income inequality and the impact of fiscal consolidation programs. Our model produces a cross-country correlation between inequality and the fiscal consolidation multipliers, which is quite similar to that in the data.
H50|The Shifting Scully Curve: International Evidence from 1870 to 2013|Scully curve predictions for growth-maximizing public sector size are estimated using panel data covering 17 industrialized nations from 1870-2013. Fixed-effects regression models find that government expenditure to GDP ratios between 27-32% are growth maximizing. The economic growth maximizing size shifted over time ranging from 9% pre-WWI to 25% Post WWII with less precise estimates suggesting 30% during inter-war years. A flattening out of the Scully curve occurs after the mid 1970s with the exception of the Nordic countries, which drive up government size considerably. As well, IV estimates of the Scully relationship suggest that the Scully curve may be subject to some reverse causality.
H50|Public–Private Partnership Systems in the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, and Indonesia|Infrastructure plays a critical role in boosting the economy’s overall productivity and development toward improving the quality of life. Public–private partnership (PPP) is considered as one of the key modalities for sustainable infrastructure development. This paper analyzes and compares the PPP systems in the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, and Indonesia to identify the requirements for making this modality an effective catalyst for infrastructure’s contribution to sustainable development. These countries have used the increased capacity and transactional experience in handling these partnerships to develop their PPP markets and strengthen their institutional framework to increase the use of PPPs to provide infrastructure services. A comparative analysis is then conducted to draw lessons for other economies in developing Asia seeking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their PPPs. The analysis underscores how strong institutions, unified procurement frameworks, and effective dispute resolution mechanisms can improve the implementation of infrastructure PPPs.
H50|In-Kind Transfer and Child Development: Evidence from Subsidized Rice Program in Indonesia|In the aftermath of the Asian financial crises, the Indonesian government launched a subsidized rice program called RASKIN in 1998 to moderate the shocks of food price inflation and reduced employment to poor households. The program has been continued since then with an objective to provide food security to poor families and is currently the largest in-kind transfer in Indonesia. Using data from five rounds of the Indonesian Family Life Survey covering the period of 1993–2014, we examine the impact of RASKIN on children’s health status. Using the difference-in-difference estimator, we find that children from the households that are beneficiaries of the RASKIN program show improved health status as measured by various anthropometric measures. We further investigate the long-run gains from RASKIN by tracing the health status of children aged between 0 and 5 years old in 1993 and 1997, respectively, until their adolescence/adulthood. We find evidence of improved anthropometric health outcomes for these children in later years. The gains are found to be higher for children who started receiving the subsidized rice in the early years of childhood.
H50|The Government Spending Multiplier at the Zero Lower Bound: Evidence from the Euro Area|We use an Interacted Panel Vector Autoregressive (IPVAR) model, to investigate the effects of a government spending shock when the interest rate is at zero lower bound (ZLB). We also compare the responses of variables of interest at the ZLB with what we get when a government spending shock occurs in normal times (i.e. when the interest rate is larger than 0.25). We identify the government spending shock by sign restrictions and use the European Commission forecasts of government expenditure to account for fiscal foresight. For the baseline specification we find lower multipliers in times in which the ZLB is binding. However, fiscal foresight is not the only problem in fiscal VARs related to limited information problems. Usually, VAR models can only consider a limited number of variables due to degree of freedom problems. Several authors have shown (see Stock and Watson(2005) for a survey) how principal components extracted from a larger number of variables, can approximate unobserved factors driving most (if not all) of the macroeconomic variables. Therefore, we develop a Factor-Augmented IPVAR model (FAIPVAR) and find that the multipliers are very similar among states, ranging between 1.08 and 1.41 at the ZLB and between 1.26 and 1.39 away from it. We also divide our sample, considering two groups of countries in terms of high and low debt-to-GDP ratios. We find that countries with high levels of debt-to-GDP ratio show relatively lower multipliers. Considering the FAIPVAR model, the government spending multiplier ranges between 2.69 and 3.54 for core countries and between 0.82 and 1.37 for peripheral countries. Therefore, our findings support some recent studies, which suggest that the government spending multiplier is even larger if the debt-to-GDP ratio is low.
H50|Assessment of Government COFOG Expenditures in Selected EU Countries|The goal of the article is an assessment of government COFOG expenditure in selected EU countries in the period 1995-2016. Government expenditure and factors of their growth are crucial problem of many countries. In the context of the EU2020 strategy, supportive of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, pressure on public expenditure is in link with on-going fiscal consolidation and the legacy of the economic and financial crisis. The paper evaluates the government expenditure in compliance with the COFOG international standard. The results show that the expenditure composition differs across the EU countries, but it is also possible to identify some similarities for specific government COFOG functions, such as the large weight of social protection. The proportion of potentially growth-enhancing public expenditure, such as education, health care, R&D or public investment, affirms significant cross-country variation. Next, the article provides direct empirical evidence on cyclicality and the long-term and short-term relationship between government COFOG expenditure and output. The Johansen cointegration test and the Error Correction Model are applied for research. Findings confirm the long-term relationship between government expenditure and output but the short-term relationship is not confirmed due to a low statistical significance.
H50|Entrepreneurship Education And Risk Taking Behaviour Of Nigerian Graduates|The Federal Government of Nigeria wants every citizen to acquire functional, relevant, practical, and appropriate skills for developing competencies as equipment for the individuals to live and contribute to the development of the nation. This had lead to the introduction of Entrepreneurship Education at all level of education. Despite the importance of entrepreneurship education to Nigerian graduate upon graduation some graduate still finds it difficult to establish a business of their own because of fear of risk-taking involved. This paper discussed the relationship between entrepreneurship education and risk-taking behavior of Nigerian graduates upon graduation. The following points are mentioned in the article: entrepreneurship education, entrepreneur, attributes of an entrepreneur, entrepreneur risks and types of entrepreneur risks. Conclusion: to reduce the rate of unemployment among graduates in Nigeria, graduates must be willing to take a risk to establish their businesses. Recommendation: risk-taking attitude of students must change hence, they must develop a positive attitude towards risk-taking.
H50|Industrial policy for a Europeanindustrial renaissance. A few reflections|This paper raises and attempts to address three questions that add to the recent debate on industrial policies to promote a European “industrial renaissance”. We ask (i) What type of de-industrialisation represents a threat for Europe? (ii) What type of structural change can industrial policy steer in a context of increasing international fragmentation of production, both across European countries and worldwide? (iii) What type of industrial policy shall we advocate, that goes beyond the manufacturing sectors? With no pretence to provide all the answers or yet another wish list of policy tools, we argue that we are “doomed to choose” (Hausmann and Rodrik, 2006) what type of structural transformation is Europe in need of, in a context of harsher global competition from the emerging countries; of staggering income polarisation within Europe itself; of relentless international fragmentation of production processes. First, we claim that industrial policy should target sectors and segments of value chains that support the manufacturing sector and not necessarily represent a hollowing out of the industrial base. Second, industrial policy should target structural transformation alongside large “missions” and learn from classical debates on industrialisationled development. Interventions should therefore go beyond the traditional vertical versus horizontal tools distinction and complement a “mission oriented” plea with other tools, to avoid yet another “one size fits all” approach.
H50|La realizzazione del Piano di Investimenti per l'Europa|The Investment Plan for Europe - which is known as the Juncker Plan and is aimed at European economic recovery â€“ is estimated to provide a relatively large amount of financial resources for SMEs and different areas of public infrastructure. This estimate was based on a high value of the multiplier that was forecasted and applied to the guarantees of the approved projects. At the end of the first period (2015-2017), it was considered appropriate to review some of the international scientific literature on this Plan, in order to analyse if the results achieved up until that point coincide with its initial objectives. The main outcome of this analysis - in contrast to the success attributed to the Plan by the European Commission - is that verification is substantially unattainable, since even the quantitative results thus far disseminated for the Juncker Plan have been obtained by estimates, which have never been illustrated in a comprehensive manner.
H50|El sistema de transferencias fiscales sociales en Uruguay: un análisis de su composición y comportamiento cí­clico|In this paper, we analyze the performance over the economic cycle of different items of social-type fiscal expenditures in Uruguay during the period 1988:1 to 2015:4. The study is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a descriptive analysis of the regulations and composition governing the current system of public transfers in Uruguay. Section 3 analyses the performance of the structure of the tax-transfer system in Uruguay. Section 4 details the behavior of the different tax transfers for Uruguay, identifying their pro- or countercyclical nature. In section 5, we analyze how the way in which fiscal transfers have been updated or indexed has been able to influence the cyclical behavior of public transfers. Finally, section 6 outlines conclusions and policy recommendations.
H50|The behavior of social transfers over the business cycle: empirical evidence of Uruguay|This paper analyzes the cycle fluctuations of the social transfers in Uruguay over the period 1988.Q1 to 2016.Q3. The unobservable cyclical components are extracted from the observable time series following different empirical strategies. The results show that social transfers behave procyclical and lag the macroeconomics fluctuations. In this way, social transfers instead of contributing to stabilize the Uruguayan economy have aggravated the business cycle, and through various items of expenditure, expose the vulnerable groups of society to more adverse economic conditions.
H50|Public sector efficiency in Europe: Long-run trends, recent developments and determinants|This paper investigates the efficiency of the public sector in a sense of public performance and expenditures. For 23 European countries and for the period between 1995 and 2015 we construct a measure of public sector performance that consist of nine distinct indices for each area of public policy, such as administration, health education, economic performance, security and infrastructure. We use several efficiency techniques (FDH, order-m) and investigate input- and output-oriented efficiency of the public sector. We find that countries with small public sectors tend to be more efficient no matter which efficiency techniques we use. Because of the relatively long time span of our data, our study contributes to the literature by analyzing the effect of the financial crisis on the efficiency of the public sector in European countries. We show that after the crisis, the public sector efficiency increased especially in countries with small public sectors, while it stayed constant or worsened in countries with big public sectors. Finally, we analyze in more depth the impact of fiscal decentralization and fiscal rules on the public sector efficiency. We conclude that while decentralization is fostering efficiency, fiscal rules do not have any effect. Moreover, fiscal rules combined with decentralization may harm efficiency, consistently with the ratchet effect.
H50|Political competition and economic performance: Empirical evidence from Pakistan|The influence of politics on economic policy is not fully understood. The challenge to ensure political inclusiveness and economic prosperity remains. Perhaps, one way to attain this objective is by increasing political competition. This paper gathers empirical evidence from Pakistan, a country with a checkered political history characterized by episodes of representative, non-representative, and indirectly elected governments. In recent years, the country has witnessed a gradual strengthening of democratic rule with economic progress. Focusing on nine elections held over 1970 to 2015 the authors measure political competition and estimate its impact on economic performance. Contrary to popular conceptions about Pakistan's economic performance, they find a positive association between lack of political competition and poor economic performance. This finding holds at national as well as subnational levels in Pakistan and withstands a number of robustness tests.
H50|Impacts of fiscal policy on economic growth: Another look from institutional perspective|What is the role of economic institutions in the effectiveness of fiscal policy? This paper argues that the extent to which fiscal policy affects long-term growth depends on how economically free a country enjoys. The authors use a sample of 72 countries over the period 1990 through 2015 to provide empirical evidence on the interrelationship between government spending, economic freedom and economic growth. The non-linear effect of fiscal policy on growth is investigated by extending the classical growth regression with an interaction term between fiscal policy and economic freedom. The results suggest that it is economic freedom that determines the effect of fiscal policy on economic growth. Public investment in infrastructure can enhance long-term growth better in countries with less degree of freedom. Meanwhile, public consumption does not benefit growth but its adverse impact is mitigated if a country is more economically free. The authors also find that the determining role of institutions in emerging countries is more prominent than that in advanced economies which are pretty homogenous in economic development and have already been at a high level of economic freedom.
H50|Is the debt brake behind Germany's successful fiscal consolidation?|"Both the German federal as well as the general government recorded a surplus for the fourth time in a row in 2017. The fast consolidation after the Great Recession coincided with the transition period for the full introduction of the federal debt brake, which is sometimes interpreted as causality. At the same time Germany's economic performance is better than that of many other countries. For this reason it is nearly impossible to overrate the symbolic power of the debt brake as a seeming success story. In this paper we scrutinise the seeming success story of the debt brake. We carry out a comparative analysis of the ""structural"" consolidation of public finances in Germany for the period from 1991 until 2017 showing that the German debt brake is not the cause of the successful budget consolidation in Germany since 2010. The improvement of the general government finances since 2010 was smaller than in previous consolidation phases and was strongly supported by a favourable macroeconomic environment, and one-off effects. Finally, neither the general government sector nor the federal government would be in such a good fiscal shape, had the economy evolved less favourably since 2010. Without the blessing of a strong upswing Germany would hardly have become the fiscal role model for Europe and the German debt brake would not have become the blueprint for the European Fiscal Compact."
H50|Wofür der Bund seinen zusätzlichen Haushaltsspielraum einsetzt|In den vergangenen Jahren zeigte sich beim Bundeshaushalt stets das gleiche Bild: Die tatsächlichen Zinsausgaben fielen geringer aus als geplant und die Steuereinnahmen stiegen stärker als von der Bundesregierung angenommen. Beide Entwicklungen verschafften dem Bund neue Handlungsspielräume. In den Jahren 2013 bis 2018 summierten sich diese auf rund 82 Milliarden Euro, wovon zwei Drittel den geringer ausgefallenen Zinsausgaben und ein Drittel den höheren Steuereinnahmen zuzurechnen sind. Hinzu kommen in diesem Zeitraum höhere sonstige Einnahmen, wie zum Beispiel Gebühren, in Höhe von kumuliert 9 Milliarden Euro. Zum einen nutzte die Bundesregierung den zusätzlichen Spielraum für neue laufende Ausgaben, zum anderen baute sie eine Rücklage auf. Im Zeitraum von 2013 bis 2018 fielen die Ausgaben (ohne Zinsen) um insgesamt 67 Milliarden Euro höher aus als die Finanzplanung es vorsah - als Vergleich dient dabei stets der Mittelwert der zwei, drei und vier Jahre vor dem Ist-Jahr erschienenen Finanzpläne des Bundes. Die Rücklage beläuft sich auf mittlerweile 24 Milliarden Euro. Allerdings soll diese nicht ihrer eigentlichen Funktion als Risikopuffer gerecht werden, vielmehr will die Bundesregierung damit Vorhaben aus dem Koalitionsvertrag finanzieren. Damit handelt es sich letztlich auch um eine Ausgabensteigerung. Auf alternative Verwendungsmöglichkeiten dieses unverhofften Haushaltsspielraums - Steuerentlastung oder Schuldentilgung - verzichtet die Bundesregierung. Die Steuerquote des Bundes ist jüngst sogar gestiegen.
H50|Uniting European fiscal rules: How to strenghten the fiscal framework|The current European fiscal framework is highly complex. The multitude of fiscal rules and the discretion in their enforcement precludes an effective oversight and weakens the effectiveness of fiscal rules substantially. Against this background, we present a proposal for a careful refocusing of the framework to promote fiscal sustainability. The proposal is centered around an expenditure rule as an annual operational target supplemented by a debt-correction factor and a multi-purpose adjustment account which implements a medium-term structural balance rule. Together with a significant reduction in exemptions and escape clauses as well as less discretion in the imposition of sanctions, the proposal increases transparency and efficacy of fiscal rules at the European level.
H50|Military expenditures and shadow economy in the Baltic States: Is there a link?|The main goal of our paper is to determine the existence of a link between government (military) expenditures and the shadow economy in the Baltic States. The empirical investigation is done over the years 2003-2014 for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. We showed that there is a highly statistically significant positive dependence between the size of the shadow economy and military expenditures in the Baltic States. Our conclusion is that higher military expenditures indeed lead to a higher shadow economy and this result is robust to different model specifications. In order to demonstrate the importance of our highly statistically significant results we undertook a simulation where we calculated how much the size of the shadow economy would increase if the size of military expenditure as a percentage of GDP doubled: In Estonia such an expansion would have led to an increase in the size of the shadow economy from 27.1% to 30.1%, in Latvia from 24.7% to 26.1% and in Lithuania from 27.1% to 28.4% in 2014.
H50|Testing Wagner's Law for The Gambia, 1977-2013|Wagner’s law relates the positive nexus between public spending and economic activity, where greater economic activity leads to increased public spending. This paper examines the validity of this hypothesis for The Gambia for the period 1977-2013. Using econometric techniques of ARDL bounds test, Johansen and Juselius (1990) multivariate cointegration test, Granger causality and Toda and Yamamota (1995) Granger non-causality tests, the findings show validity for Wagner’s law for The Gambia. Therefore, the government of the Gambia should channel it’s expenditures toward the productive sectors of economy so as to promote economic growth in the country.
H50|Expansionary Austerity and Reverse Causality|Empirical studies on the effects of fiscal policy using the conventional or data-based approach and the Blanchard-method of cyclical adjustment or the Blanchard Fiscal Impulse (BFI) discovered that fiscal consolidations can be expansionary, particularly in the case of spending-cuts. In this paper, it is stated this finding is affected by reverse causality, i.e. increasing GDP causally decreases expenditure-GDP-ratios if the cyclical adjustment strategy fails to correct for cyclical effects. It is also illustrated that the BFI as used in the literature does not appropriately control for cyclical effects in the case of expenditure-GDP-ratios and the resulting BFI is endogenously correlated with the economic cycle. This might explain why previous studies based on the BFI pointed to counter-intuitive findings when examining cuts in government expenditure. Replicating one prominent example of literature on expansionary austerity and comparing both the results based on the BFI and the results based on standard cyclical adjustment strategies, only the BFI-based results show expansionary effects of fiscal consolidations, while these effects disappear after applying standard methods of cyclical adjustment.
H50|Happiness and Public Expenditure: Evidence from a Panel Analysis|The present study examines empirically the relationship between Happiness and public spending. We use a panel data from 2006 to 2015 for about 132 countries. We first estimated a Pooled, fixed effect and finally a GMM model to deal with the endogeneity problem. Our main findings suggest, first, that high levels of public expenditure are associated with greater Happiness around the world. Second, as expected, social support, Healthy life expectancy, Freedom to make life choices and confidence in national government contribute significantly to Happiness.
H50|Do Military Expenditures Boost Profit Rates?|Understanding the effect of military expenditures on profit rates can provide important insights on the use of government spending. We utilize the panel dynamic ordinary least square method to examine that relationship for 32 major countries from the period of 1963-2008. We find that while military expenditures increase profit rates in arm-exporting countries, the opposite occurs in the case of arms-importing countries.
H50|Central Bank Quantitative Easing as an Emerging Political Liability|Officials from major central banks have previously acknowledged QE programs’ distributional effects but expected aggregate economic benefits of these unconventional policies to outweigh their costs. Post-crisis asset price appreciation became well entrenched under the effect of QE, which out-paced median wage growth to unintentionally burden low-to-middle income households and individuals with limited asset ownership. Subsequently, rising inequality fueled discontent and contributed to the rise of anti-establishment political candidates Efforts by elected officials to ease the effects of policy-induced inequality would likely bolster support toward further redistribution policies such as “helicopter money” to threaten central bank monetary policy independence
H50|Un réexamen de la relation entre dépenses publiques et croissance économique dans les pays en développements à partir d'un modèle de panel dynamique<BR>[A reexamination of the relation between public expenses and economic growth in developing countries from a dynamic panel model]|Several empirical studies analysed the relation between public expenditures and economic growth but the unanimity is not made on the real nature of the relation that exist between its two variables. Our study re-examine agreement specifying the nature of relation that may exist between public expenditures and the economic growth in 20 developing countries. Results coming from our valuations by the GMM method in dynamic panel highlight a non-linear relation on one hand between total public expenditures and economic growth on another hand between public investment and the growth. Our study also specify, margin in which the different variables get a positive and significant impact on the growth in developing countries
H50|Openness and Government Size:The Compensation and Efficiency Hypotheses Considered for Nigeria|This paper investigates the relationship among financial openness, trade openness and government size in Nigeria. The study employed the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration to investigate the relationship among the variables. Empirical estimates revealed that financial openness is significantly and negatively related to government size in line with the conventional wisdom that capital mobility may undermine the ability of governments to tax and raise revenue to finance government expenditure which is termed as the efficiency hypothesis. In addition, a positive relationship was reported between trade openness and government size which implies that there is evidence to support compensation hypothesis. The findings of the study suggest that openness has made the country highly vulnerable to external risk and there is need for the government to increase government expenditure and most especially, devote more funds to social welfare expenditure. This will help cushion the negative effects openness and its associated risks has on the country’s citizens.
H50|Fairness and the unselfish demand for redistribution by taxpayers and welfare recipients|We illustrate how the desire to live in a fair society that rewards individual effort and hard work triggers an unselfish though rational demand for redistribution. This leads the well off to prefer higher taxes and the poor to reject extreme progressivity. We then provide evidence of these behaviors using a nationally representative survey from Italy. Our empirical analysis confirms that a stronger aversion to unfair distributive outcomes is associated with a higher support for redistribution by individuals with high income and to a lower demand for redistribution by those with low income.
H50|Fiscal Consolidation Programs and Income Inequality|Following the Great Recession, many European countries implemented fiscal consolidation policies aimed at reducing government debt. Using three independent data sources and three different empirical approaches, we document a strong positive relationship between higher income inequality and stronger recessive impacts of fiscal consolidation programs across time and place. To explain this finding, we develop a life-cycle, overlapping generations economy with uninsurable labor market risk. We calibrate our model to match key characteristics of a number of European economies, including the distribution of wages and wealth, social security, taxes and debt, and study the effects of fiscal consolidation programs. We find that higher income risk induces precautionary savings behavior, which decreases the proportion of credit-constrained agents in the economy. Credit-constrained agents have less elastic labor supply responses to fiscal consolidation achieved through either tax hikes or public spending cuts, and this explains the relationship between income inequality and the impact of fiscal consolidation programs. Our model produces a cross-country correlation between inequality and the fiscal consolidation multipliers, which is quite similar to that in the data.
H50|The social and economic preferences of a tech-savvy generation|We empirically characterise Millennials’ policy preferences with respect welfare provision across nine EU member states. Our main findings indicate two different tendencies driving a split in young people’s policy preferences over different policy objectives. The first tendency depends on the local economic context, calling for more redistributive policies and a more supportive role of the state when job opportunities are limited. The second tendency, which is unrelated to economic factors, drives Millennials’ positive attitudes towards the future and calls for policies that relate more to the idea of better risk-sharing and equal opportunities within the society.
H50|A Second Thought on Estimating Expansionary Fiscal Policy Effects in the U.S|This paper revisits mixed findings of the expansionary fiscal spending effect in the U.S. An array of standard Vector-Autoregressive (VAR) models have been implemented to capture inconsistent effects of the fiscal expansion across studies. Findings in this paper consistently reveal that, first, government expenditures often generate less positive influence than government purchases; second, leaving aside the state and local government spending, federal government purchases alone have a very limited influence on the economy; third, 2007 recession significantly weakened the effectiveness of fiscal expansionary policy thereafter. Following these findings, this paper questions the validity of using government purchases alone to conclude the comprehensive effect of fiscal expansion.
H50|Government Size and Economic Growth in Turkey: A Threshold Regression Analysis|We examine the relationship between the government size and economic growth by using threshold regression model and quarterly data over the period 1998:1-2015:1 for Turkey. Our results provide a strong evidence for the existence of a non-linear relationship. The estimated threshold levels, as a percentage of GDP, are 16.5 for the government total expenditures, 12.6 for consumption expenditures and 3.9 for investment expenditures. We find that an increase in the government size leads to a significant rise (decline) in economic growth rate when the government size is below (above) the threshold level, confirming the predictions of Armey curve. Our findings have a clear policy implication: since the realized government consumption and total expenditures are well above the estimated threshold levels, a reduction in the government size would boost the growth rate.
H50|The Government Spending Multiplier at the Zero Lower Bound: Evidence from the United States|We estimate state-dependent government spending multipliers for the United States. We use an Interacted Vector Autoregression (IVAR) model to capture the time-varying monetary policy characteristics including the recent zero interest rate lower bound (ZLB) state. We identify government spending shocks by sign restrictions and use a government spending growth forecast series to account for the effects of anticipated fiscal policy. In our baseline specification we find that government spending multipliers range from 3.4 to 3.7 at the ZLB. Away from the ZLB, multipliers range from 1.5 to 2.7. Next, we address the limited information problem typically inherent in VARs by the help of a Factor-Augmented IVAR (FAIVAR). We find that multipliers are lower in this case, ranging from 2.0 to 2.1 at the ZLB and between 1.5 and 1.8 away from it. Thus, in both specifications we find that multipliers are higher, when the interest rate is lower. Our results are consistent with recent theories that predict larger multipliers at the ZLB.
H50|Government Spending With Public Debt, Economic Growth And Fiscal Balance: Evidences From India|This paper has examined the impact of public expenditure on economic growth and viability of fiscal policy when the public expenditure is financed by public borrowing. The ratio of gross fiscal deficit to net national product and the ratio of gross fiscal deficit to total expenditure have been considered as indicators of solvency in fiscal balance. The study is based on theoretical framework and results of econometric analyses. The basic argument of this paper is that if public expenditure is financed by government borrowing, but expenditure fails to generate sufficient growth in income, it will be difficult to repay the loan and fiscal balance will deteriorate. As a result, the viability of the fiscal policy will be under question. The data in the Indian context show that revenue expenditure has increased significantly over time. Since revenue expenditure includes many non-developmental and less productive components, it may not be helpful for economic growth. The results of time series analysis show that the ratio of gross fiscal deficit to net national product (NNP) has increased with increase in total expenditure of the government indicating non-sustainability of fiscal balance. The study also shows that private capital has significant positive impact on NNP but the effect of fiscal deficit on economic growth is not clear.
H50|The Government Expenditure Structure and Economic growth|This article examines the effect of the government expenditure structure on the economic growth. The objective is to determine which components of public expenditures are growth enhancing and which growth retarding. The theoretical model is set into the endogenous growth framework and describes the growth mechanism of productive and unproductive government expenditures. The growth impact of public spending composition is analysed for 18 European countries from 1996 to 2012. The empirical part is based on the panel data analysis. The empirical findings suggest that reallocating public resources towards education and health can promote growth. On the contrary higher expenditures on social spending and defence are likely to be growth-retarding.
H50|Assessing the evidence on neighborhood effects from Moving to Opportunity|Abstract The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment randomly assigned housing vouchers that could be used in low-poverty neighborhoods. Consistent with the literature, I find that receiving an MTO voucher had no effect on outcomes like earnings, employment, and test scores. However, after studying the assumptions identifying neighborhood effects with MTO data, this paper reaches a very different interpretation of these results than found in the literature. I first specify a model in which the absence of effects from the MTO program implies an absence of neighborhood effects. I present theory and evidence against two key assumptions of this model: that poverty is the only determinant of neighborhood quality and that outcomes only change across one threshold of neighborhood quality. I then show that in a more realistic model of neighborhood effects that relaxes these assumptions, the absence of effects from the MTO program is perfectly compatible with the presence of neighborhood effects. This analysis illustrates why the implicit identification strategies used in the literature on MTO can be misleading.

H50|On the middle 70%. The impact of fiscal policy on the emerging middle class in Latin America using Commitment to Equity|This paper analyzes the effects of indirect and direct taxes, as well as monetary and in-kind transfers on the income distribution in nine Latin American countries applying the CEQ methodology and using household and expenditure microdata around 2010. In particular, we focus on the effect of fiscal policies on two groups of the emerging middle class: the vulnerable and the middle class. We find that while the vulnerable tend to be net receivers in fiscal terms, especially when including in-kind transfers, the middle class seems to be mainly a net payer. This might be aggravated by the perception of a relatively low quality of in-kind transfers, notably in education and health-care services. We provide some evidence based on subjective surveys pointing in this direction.
H50|The Sustainable Development Goals, Domestic Resource Mobilization and the Poor|Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will require fiscal resources to deliver the floors in social protection, social services and infrastructure embedded in them. A significant portion of these resources is expected to come from tax collection in developing countries. Raising additional revenues domestically, however, may leave a significant portion of the poor with less cash to buy food and other essential goods. The demand for additional resources must be balanced against the competing need to protect poor households from becoming poorer as a result of taxes.

H50|Measuring the Strength of the Theories of Government Size|Existing theoretical and empirical evidence on the determinants of government expenditure is inconclusive. We posit that the main cause of this problem is theory uncertainty, which arises due to the fact that the different theories imply different mutually compatible and interrelated mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel model averaging method to perform model averaging in linear regression systems that allows for endogeneity. Using data for more than 90 countries we assess the evidentiary support for nine different theories. Our results suggest that the government size and its components are explained by multiple mechanisms that work simultaneously but differ in their impact and importance. In particular, for general government total expenditure we find decisive evidence for the demography theory and a strong evidence for the globalization and political institution theory. In the case of central government total expenditure, we find that income inequality and macroeconomic policy play a decisive role in addition to demography.
H50|Assessing Kuwaiti Energy Pricing Reforms|From mid-2014 Kuwait has experienced a substantial drop in its petroleum export price and,consequently, government revenue, causing a severe fiscal deficit and impaired economic performance. Cutting energy subsidies has become a policy priority. In the face of widespread opposition, the government raised gasoline prices in August 2016, proclaiming such reform the key to solving economic problems; yet recent policy discussions have not addressed the mechanism of pricing reforms. The paper offers a quantification and assessment of energy pricing reform in the current low petroleum price environment via a general equilibrium model of the Kuwaiti economy that embodies the structure of its economy and its labor market, its oligopolistic industries, and external flows associated with its sovereign wealth fund. Simulations clarify the required adjustments, including the seldom discussed expatriate labor exit and the decline in oligopoly rents. While necessary, subsidy reform implies trade-offs, notably between fiscal stabilization and cost of living sustainability. The results confirm that successful implementation must be accompanied by carefully designed mitigation measures and associated microeconomic reforms.
H50|From Fiscal Austerity towards Growth-Enhancing Fiscal Policy in Ukraine|The study analyses the dynamics and the structure of Ukraine’s public finances. It assesses the medium-term impact of fiscal austerity 2014-2016, examines fiscal sustainability and estimates further fiscal adjustment efforts. It evaluates the economic and social implications of current fiscal policies especially on education, health and other social indicators. It examines the benefits and costs of the medium-term budget for 2017‑2019 with an emphasis on evolving challenges and puts forward policy recommendations aimed at a successful implementation of growth-enhancing economic reforms.
H50|Fiscal Stabilization and Growth; Evidence from Industry-level Data for Advanced and Developing Economies|Medium-term growth can be enhanced by fiscal stabilization. However, to date, no systematic effort has been made to study the specific channels through which fiscal stabilization affects growth. This paper examines the effect of fiscal stabilization on industrial growth and how this effect depends on different technological characteristics. It does so by applying a difference-in-difference approach to an unbalanced panel of 22 manufacturing industries for 55 advanced and developing economies over the period 1970-2014. The results suggest that fiscal stabilization fosters growth in industries with: i) higher external financial dependence and lower asset fixity; ii) higher degree of labor intensity; iii) higher investment lumpiness and relationship-specific input usage. These effects tend to be larger during economic recessions. The results are robust to different measures of fiscal stabilization and the inclusion of various interactions between a broad set of macroeconomic variables and production technologies.
H50|Competitiveness, consumer confidence and election outcomes|The literature on the political business cycle (PBC) suggests that politicians systematically manipulate economic conditions in order to increase their chances of re-election. The list of variables that have been found to have a significant effect on the probability of re-election includes macroeconomic (inflation rate, unemployment rate, output growth rate) and fiscal (budget balance, level of expenditures and tax revenues) outcomes. This paper focuses on the question whether price and non-price competitiveness indicators together with consumer confidence index have a statistically significant effect. Thus, this paper addresses two empirical questions. First, in light of the globalisation process and on-going comparisons among national economies, could price and non-price indicators serve as a proxy for voters when deciding on whether to penalise or reward the incumbent? And second, based on the economic theory of voting, is consumer confidence index a better indicator of re-election probability compared to unemployment and output growth rates? Using a dataset of EU member states over the 2000-2015 period and by applying probit/logit analysis we test both questions.
H50|Impact of public debt (un)sustainability on fiscal policy effectiveness in Croatia|This paper analyses the impact of public debt level and (un)sustainability on fiscal spending effectiveness in Croatia. Public debt sustainability is analyzed using standard indicators of fiscal vulnerability and fiscal stability, accompanied with identification of regime changes in the public debt trajectory. Public debt sustainability analysis is used to analyze trends and tendencies, as well as to indicate periods of fiscal unsustainability in Croatia in period from 2001 to 2015. Using switching regression and SVAR approach it is also empirically tested how public debt level affects the effectiveness of fiscal policy in Croatia in the same period. Results show a negative impact of recession on public debt sustainability and confirm the main thesis that public debt level significantly affects and reduces the effectiveness of fiscal policy in Croatia.
H50|Potraga za optimalnim i efikasnim javnim financijama u Hrvatskoj: od reformi do zaduživanja|U radu se analiziraju osnovni trendovi i tendencije u javnim financijama u Hrvatskoj u kontekstu potrage za optimalnim i efikasnim fiskalnim sustavom. Analiza je usmjerena na razdoblje od 1994. do 2016. godine. Prvo se analizira visina i struktura javnih prihoda, a zatim javnih rashoda. Analiza ukazuje na cikličku osjetljivost javnih prihoda, posebno indirektnih poreza, te nemogućnost adekvatne prilagodbe visine i strukture rashoda u uvjetima recesije. Bez obzira na niz reformi i promjena, posebno u segmentu poreznog sustava, fiskalne neravnoteže i proračunski manjkovi karakteriziraju hrvatski sustav javnih financija u gotovo cijelom promatranom razdoblju. Navedeno je utjecalo na rast javnog duga do razina fiskalne neodrživosti. Taj proces je pak utjecao na rast rizika zemlje što ima dugoročne posljedice na cjelokupno gospodarstvo, a ne samo na sustav javnih financija i problem refinanciranja javnog duga.
H50|Growth of public consumption in Austria: Testing Wagner's law and Baumol's cost disease|In this paper, we analyze the development of public consumption expenditure in Austria starting in the 1940s. We focus our attention on two hypotheses as to why public consumption expenditure has been constantly increasing: Wagner's law and Baumol's cost disease. The estimated income elasticity of demand for public consumption expenditure of 0.85 suggests that Wagner's law is not confirmed. In contrast, price-inelastic demand combined with a strong increase in the prices of public services relative to private goods suggest that Baumol's cost disease is at work. A counterfactual exercise shows that in the absence of the rise in the relative price of publicly provided goods, current public consumption would equal 15.98% of GDP instead of the actually observed 19.92%. We further confirm the main observations using a cointegration model.
H50|Drivers of public sector growth in Imperial Austria 1870-1913|We test several hypotheses concerning the growth of public expenditure by the Austrian monarchy between 1870 and 1913 in relation to Wagner's law, as well as the impact of increasing public indebtedness and the expanding role of the Imperial Council towards the end of the analyzed period, using the bounds testing approach and Granger-causality analysis. We find evidence for Wagner's law in the case of public investment, but not general public expenditure. Increases in general public expenditure were mostly driven by the public debt, rather than by increasing national income. We do not find evidence that institutional reforms by the Imperial Council changed the trends in public expenditure.
H50|Optimal Social Insurance and Health Inequality|This paper integrates into public economics a biologically founded, stochastic process of individual ageing. The novel approach enables us to investigate the interaction between health and retirement policy in order to quantitatively characterize the optimal joint design of the social insurance system today and in response to future medical progress, and its implications for health inequality. Calibrating our model to Germany, we find that currently the public health and pension system is approximately optimal. Future progress in medical technology calls for a potentially drastic increase in health spending that typically shall be accompanied with a lower pension savings rate and a higher retirement age. Medical progress and higher health spending is predicted to lead to more health inequality.
H50|How costly are public sector inefficiencies? A theoretical framework for rationalising fiscal consolidations|Fiscal adjustments consisting of spending cuts or tax increases are generally presented as the unavoidable way for achieving public finance sustainability in the long term. However, this view of fiscal consolidation processes is limited as it leaves out other aspects related to public sector performance which are relevant not only from the macroeconomic but also from the microeconomic perspective. This paper models Public Sector Performance (PSP) by proposing a theoretical framework that integrates the conventional methodology for measuring its productive efficiency and the monetary assessment of social welfare changes linked to public policy reforms. Two equivalent measures of social welfare change generated by improving (or worsening) productive efficiency are deduced using duality theory. The first is obtained from the cost function, while the second arises directly from the production function. The results reveal that taking advantage of budgetary savings obtained from this approach constitutes a valuable tool for designing welfare-enhancing fiscal consolidation packages, meanwhile promoting sound fiscal balances and growth prospects over the long term.
H50|General equilibrium effects of public adaptation in agriculture in LDCs: Evidence from Ethiopia|Ethiopia is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. This is because its important economic sector, agriculture, is virtually rain-fed. The role of the sector in the current economic structure and the potency of the anticipated biophysical impacts of climate change necessitates proactive adaptation in agriculture. This, however, breeds questions of adaptation costs and adaptation finance. This study attempts to derive plausible range of planned adaptation costs in agriculture along with their economy-wide and regional effects in Ethiopia. It also assess the economy-wide and regional effects of the likely options available to a government of a least-developed country to finance adaptation in agriculture. The results show that planned public adaptation in agriculture puts pressure on government surplus, impedes on manufacturing and private services, and GDP of urbanized regions. As such, it may strain the current macroeconomic endeavors of the country which puts government driven structural transformation and reducing fiscal deficit relative to GDP at the center. Government of Ethiopia may reconcile this by laying out incentives to urban agriculture and private investment in agriculture. Besides, foreign support in the form of biotechnology transfer and debt-relief may help to control the side effects of grants on foreign exchange market and trade balance.
H50|The Future of Human Health, Longevity, and Health Costs|We investigate the future of human longevity, morbidity and health costs in a novel, multi-period OLG model with endogenous medical R&D and endogenous survival. Our calibrated model implies substantial future increases in longevity that are associated with both reductions in morbidity and a rising health expenditure share in GDP. Extending health care rationing has potentially sizable effects on morbidity and longevity, with dramatic welfare losses particularly for future generations.
H50|Balanced budget rules and fiscal outcomes: Evidence from historical constitutions|This paper studies the reduced-form effects of constitutional-level balanced budget rules (BBRs) on fiscal outcomes. Using historical data for a large set of countries dating back to the nineteenth century and applying a difference-in-difference design we find that the introduction of a constitutional BBR leads to a reduced probability of experiencing a sovereign debt crisis. We estimate that debt-to-GDP ratio decreases by around eleven percentage points on average, most of these consolidation being explained by decreasing expenditures rather than increasing tax revenues. Using the same methodology and sample, we do not find evidence that non-constitutional BBRs included in national legislation affect these variables. Additional estimates gained from applying the synthetic control method on nine selected case study countries in Africa, Europe, and Latin America are consistent with the main findings, but also highlight the importance of country specific circumstances when evaluating the success of BBRs.
H50|Subsidized and non subsidized R&D projects: Do they differ?|Little is known about whether and to what extent the outcome of subsidized and non-subsidized R&D projects differ. In this paper we exploit a novel dataset of patent applications filed in Germany between 1995-2005, which allows us to identify if a patent application stems from a subsidized project or not. We use a variety of patent indicators to elucidate to what extent successful subsidized and non-subsidized R&D projects within the same firm differ. Results show that patent applications from subsidized R&D projects have a higher private value, are more often co-applied, more general, but less original, and have larger inventor teams when compared to all other patent applications filed by the same firms. These differences seem to reflect that thematic R&D programs aim to support collaborative R&D projects that have an immediate economic utilization of results.
H50|The impact of fiscal consolidations on the functional components of government expenditures|This paper analyses how the functional components and sub-components of government expenditures are affected by fiscal consolidations. A fixed-effects estimator is employed over a panel of 15 European Union countries during the period 1990–2012. The results show that spending on public services increases during fiscal consolidations, while spending on defence, public order, health, education and social protection is significantly cut. A more disaggregated analysis proves that fiscal consolidations are harmful for important social expenditures, in particular, for those related to citizens’ safety, health assistance, social protection and investment in human capital. This evidence is even stronger in a particular group of countries, known in the literature as PIIGS. Hence, fiscal consolidations can have important implications on the living standards of the more economically vulnerable citizens.
H50|The effect of public support on investment and R&D: An empirical evaluation on European manufacturing firms|This paper investigates the effect of government support on investment and on R&D expenditure. The empirical analysis is based on a large representative and cross-country comparative sample of manufacturing firms across seven European countries. Estimates from a non-parametric matching procedure suggest that public grants have a positive effect both on firms' investment and R&D, implying that recipient firms spend more than they would have without public aid. This may suggest that the possibility of perfect crowding out between private and public funds can be rejected. More in detail, grants appear to consistently affect traditional investment and similarly, R&D incentives have a positive impact on research spending. The paper also finds that grants trigger the use of long medium term credit suggesting that public policy may possibly help firms facing financial constraints and foster their growth. Finally, the analysis reveals some heterogeneity across the seven countries considered.
H50|The local economic impacts of regeneration projects: Evidence from UK's Single Regeneration Budget|We study the local economic impacts of a major regeneration programme aimed at enhancing the quality of life of local people in deprived neighbourhoods in the UK. The analysis is based on a panel of firm and area level data available at small spatial scales. Our identification strategies involve: a) exploiting the fine spatial scale of our data to study how effects vary with distance to the intervention area; and b) comparing places close to treatment in early rounds of the programme with places close to treatment in future rounds. We consider the long run impact of schemes funded between 1995 and 1997 on outcomes up to 2009. Our estimates suggest that the programme increased workplace employment in the intervention area but this had no impact on the employment rates of local residents.
H50|Could the decrease in Belgian government debt-servicing costs offset increased age-related expenditure?|This paper argues that none of the secular trends that have driven down real interest rates over the past decades is likely to reverse in the near future. Government debt-servicing costs have therefore decreased significantly and can be expected to decrease further over the coming years. We calculate the direct gains accruing to the Belgian government from lower net debt interest payments and contrast them to the projected future increases in age-related expenditures. If interest rates remain on their current levels and savings on interest payments are channelled to cover the increases in age-related expenditures, they will cover two thirds of financing needs in these areas until 2030.
H50|La spesa sanitaria delle Regioni in Italia - Saniregio2017|Il nuovo rapporto SaniRegio2017 fornisce un'analisi della spesa sanitaria corrente delle singole Regioni italiane. SaniRegio introduce un meccanismo di calcolo del fabbisogno standard basato su di un modello empirico derivato dalla funzione di costo dei servizi sanitari che considera come variabile dipendente la spesa storica corrente di ciascuna Regione e, tra i principali driver del fabbisogno, tiene conto di una pluralità di dimensioni legate al contesto socio-economico dei territori. Il Rapporto mostra come a fronte di una livello globale di spesa inefficiente stimato nel 16,2% della spesa storica, pari a circa 15,4 miliardi di euro, la riduzione di risorse si concentrerebbe maggiormente nelle regioni del sud; prendendo in considerazione anche l'ammontare di risorse sufficiente a colmare l'output-gap negativo, il possibile risparmio globale di spesa si ridurrebbe drasticamente, attestandosi al 2,5% della spesa storica, pari a circa 3 miliardi di euro.
H50|Increasing of Cost Efficiency as a Trend of Public Law Entities’ Activity Intensification in a Public Administration Sector|The paper relies upon the fact that actually there are no proper conditions created in Russia to increase the performance of public law entities both in state (municipal) sector and state (municipal) services, their availability, and quality provision. The aim of this paper is studying the activity of public law entities of all levels to increase the efficiency of Russia’s budget system costs. To achieve the goal, authors started to solve problems like indicating the place of Russia in a world ratings and indicators showing the quality of the state activity, defining a set of approaches to increase the efficiency of performance-based budgeting, examining the concept of budget system reform, identifying appropriate conditions to increase the efficiency of federal and local budgets, describing the essential problems of public law entities’ activity in increasing the cost efficiency course and their solutions. Some conclusions in introducing of state entities’ budget costs standards, proper budget transfers’ allocation pattern, state policy funds’ diversification, and budget funds flows’ as well as public law activity’s transparency gain are provided in the paper.
H50|Providing the Budget Transparency and State Projects Efficiency Monitoring in Russia|The article is concerned with state projects as the basic tool of increasing the efficiency of budget costs at programme based budget costs planning. Providing the transparency and responsibility of state authorities, state projects’ efficiency monitoring determine the need to create the open framework of budget measures and public authorities’ transparent activity. The paper is devoted to the development of state projects and increasing the efficiency of their implementing and control process through balancing between the complicated state policy objectives and brand new reduced budget capacity rates. A set of goals such as considering the state projects’ technique, providing the transparency and efficiency of state projects’ costs, examining the methodology of state projects’ development, increasing their transparency and implementation efficiency, suggesting the all-stages state projects’ efficiency evaluation technique were highlighted in the paper. Authors concluded that increasing the openness, transparency, control and providing the state projects’ development monitoring is essential for proper budget functioning.
H50|Economic growth and escaping the poverty trap: how does development aid work?|This paper introduces a theoretical framework for studying the effectiveness of aid for a recipient country, receiving aid to finance its public investment. It contributes to the debate on the nexus between aid and economic growth and in particular on the conditionality of aid effects. Focusing on autonomous technology, government effort, corruption in the use of aid, fixed cost and efficiency in public investment, we can distinguish 4 levels of circumstances following which, the same aid flows may have very different effects. Given donor’s rules, we determine conditions under which the foreign aid can generate economic growth in the long run for the recipient. We also discuss the conditions leading to an economic take-off and an escape from the poverty trap. Analyses of the dynamics of capital also give conditions for a convergence towards a middle income trap or endogenous fluctuations around it.

H50|New Findings on the Fiscal Impact of Immigration in the United States|The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2016) report on the economic and fiscal effects of immigration included the first set of comprehensive fiscal impacts published in twenty years. The estimates highlight the pivotal role of the public goods assumption. If immigrants are assigned the average cost of public goods, such as national defense and interest on the debt, then immigration’s fiscal impact is negative in both the short and long run. If, instead, immigrants are assigned the marginal cost of public goods, then the long-run fiscal impact is positive and the short-run effect is negative but very small (less negative than that of natives). Highly educated immigrants confer large positive fiscal impacts, contributing far more in taxes than they consume in public benefits. To the extent that immigrants impose net costs, these are concentrated at the state and local level and are largely due to the costs of public schooling.
H50|Incumbency Disadvantage in U.S. National Politics: The Role of Policy Inertia and Prospective Voting|"We document that postwar U.S. national elections show a strong pattern of incumbency disadvantage"": If the presidency has been held by a party for some time, that party tends to lose seats in Congress. We develop a model of partisan politics with policy inertia and prospective voting to explain this finding. Positive and normative implications of the model are explored."
H50|Cyclical sensitivity of public finances in former Yugoslavian countries (2001–2014)|The aim of this paper is to analyse fiscal policy in former Yugoslavian countries over the period 2001–2014. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, we build a homogenous database to describe the evolution of main fiscal aggregates in each country, using the same analytical structure. Second, we analyse national tax structures to find if common patterns are still present, or if they have evolved in different ways over time. Third, we pool data to analyse and compute the cyclical sensitivity of budget balance, taxes and expenditure to the output gap. Our results show that tax structures are still similar and that economic cycle is very relevant to explain the dynamics of deficit and expenditure, but not revenues.
H50|Longevity, age-structure, and optimal schooling|The mechanism stating that longer life implies larger investment in human capital, is premised on the view that individual decision-making governs the relationship between longevity and education. This relationship is revisited here from the perspective of optimal period school life expectancy, obtained from the utility maximization of the whole population characterized by its age structure and its age-specific fertility and mortality. Realistic life tables such as model life tables are mandatory, because the age distribution of mortality matters, notably at infant and juvenile ages. Optimal period school life expectancy varies with life expectancy and fertility. The application to French historical data from 1806 to nowadays shows that the population age structure has indeed modified the relationship between longevity and optimal schooling.

H50|What Motivates French Pork: Political Career Concerns or Private Connections?|This paper uses the detailed curricula of French ministers and the detailed accounts of French municipalities to identify governmental investment grants targeted to specific jurisdictions. We distinguish between municipalities in which a politician held office before being appointed as a government’s member and those in which current ministers lived during their childhood. We provide evidence that municipalities in which a minister held office during her career experience a 45% increase in the amount of discretionary investment subsidies they receive during the time the politician they are linked to serves as minister. In contrast, we do not find any evidence that subsidies flow to municipalities from which ministers originate. Additional evidence advocate in favour of a key role of network and knowledge accumulated through connections, illustrated by a persistence of the impact of intergovernmental ties.
H50|日本は「格差社会」になったのか : 比較経済史にみる日本の所得格差|日本国内では格差の問題が社会的関心を集め、日本はもはや「一億総中流社会」ではなく「格差社会」であるという認識が浸透しつつある。本論分では、比較経済史の視座から日本における所得格差の長期的変遷を俯瞰し、日本は本当に「格差社会」になったのかを検証する。高度成長期に「格差なき成長」を遂げたわが国は1980年代には国際的にみても平等度の高い社会を実現した。この「日本型平等社会」の特質は再配分前の所得における世帯を単位とする平等にあり、企業による正社員への人的資本投資と雇用保障、男性正社員を世帯主とする標準世帯、夫婦による性別役割分業、および非稼得者への私的扶助を前提としていた。しかし、1980年代以降の急速な少子高齢化と世帯構造の多様化、さらに1990年以降の長期不況はこれらの前提を大きく揺るがし、既存の制度に包摂されない社会の構成員を増大させることになった。日本における格差社会の特徴は富裕層の富裕化を伴わない「低所得層の貧困化」にあり、世界の趨勢とは一線を画している。日本の直面する真の課題は貧困化と革新力の低迷であり、世帯よりも個人を、同質性よりも多様性を尊重する新たな制度を構築しなければならない。

H50|Is Poland a welfare state?|We determine whether Poland is a welfare state by looking at social expenditures as a share of GDP, taking into account that the share tends to increase with the level of income. By this criterion Poland is a welfare state. The share of social expenditure in GDP is high in Poland compared to countries with similar income levels, although still lower than in the majority of wealthier EU Member States. The structure of social expenditure in Poland is marked by high pension expenditure. Education spending is close to the EU average. Low public health expenditure, on the other hand, diverges from EU standards. Following the introduction of the Family 500+ Programme, Poland has become one of the top EU spenders on family policy. The main challenge for social policy is to improve the quality of health care and limit the negative impact of certain types of social expenditure on labour force participation.
H50|Current Expenditure Upswings in Good Times and Capital Expenditure Downswings in Bad Times?: New Evidence from Developing Countries|This paper studies the cyclical properties of two key expenditure categories (current and public investment spending) during the different phases of the business cycle (good times and bad times). Anecdotal evidence suggests that policymakers usually cannot resist the temptation of spending more on current expenditure in good times, but only pick capital expenditures to adjust during bad times. The paper answers the following questions: do current and capital expenditures react to the business cycle? If so, by how much, and why? In a sample of more than 100 developing countries and 30 developed countries observed between 1980 and 2014, a new empirical regularity specific to developing countries is identified: upswings are associated with increases in current primary expenditures (e.g., wages, transfers) only, while public investment falls and current spending remains acyclical during downturns. Evidence is also presented that this asymmetrical response is more pronounced in countries where incumbent politicians face shorter time horizons and weak institutions. Other type of factors traditionally discussed in the literature (limited creditworthiness, fiscal rules, and tax base volatility) have limited explanatory power.
