O49|The Sun’s Wrath: Economic Effects of Solar Activity|We provide empirical evidence on the negative relationship between intense solar activity and GDP in OECD countries. Among the different sectors, we find that the information and communication sector is the most adversely affected by space weather.
O49|The Return on Information Technology: Who Benefits Most?|Using a novel comprehensive data set of IT investment at the firm level, we find that a firm investing an additional euro in IT increases value added by 1 euro and 38 cents on average. This marginal product of IT investment increases with firm size and varies across sectors. IT explains about 10% of productivity dispersion across firms. While we find substantial returns of IT at the firm level, such returns are much lower at the aggregate level. This is due to underinvestment in IT (IT capital deepening is low) and misallocation of IT investments.
O49|Towards a Holistic Innovation Policy: Can the Swedish National Innovation Council Serve as a Role Model?|A holistic innovation policy is defined in this article as a policy that integrates all public actions that influence or may influence innovation processes. The Swedish National Innovation Council (NIC) was created by the Swedish Prime Minister, Stefan Löfven, in February 2015. It is personally chaired by the Prime Minister, which is unusual for similar councils in other countries. Another atypical characteristic of the Swedish NIC is that it has a dominant and wide focus on innovation policy. In other countries, such councils focus predominantly on science and/or research policy and treat innovation policy, if at all, as an “appendix” to research policy. The purpose of this article is to answer the following four questions: A. Has Swedish innovation policy recently been moving in the direction of a more holistic innovation policy? If so, how and in what respects? B. Has the Swedish National Innovation Council (NIC) had an influence on Swedish innovation policy and has it played a role in the transition towards a holistic innovation policy? Which role and how? C. Have conceptual specifications and advancements, such as innovation systems (in a broad sense), functional public procurement, additionality, and holistic innovation policy played a role in the changes in Swedish innovation policy? D. Can Sweden serve as a role model for other countries in these respects?
O49|産業別労働生産性の国際比較 : 水準とダイナミクス|供給サイドの制約（例：労働力人口の減少）に直面する日本において、生産性向上が実務・政策面における最重要課題の一つとなっている。生産性向上に向けた効果的な方策を検討するためには、生産性を巡る現状を正確に理解する必要があるだろう。こうした問題意識を踏まえて、本稿では、まず、分析用のデータセットが入手可能な最新年次である2015年の産業レベルデータを用いることで、近年の日本における産業別労働生産性が他の先進諸国（米、独、英、仏）に比してどの程度の「水準」にあるのかを確認する。その上で、2015年までの約20年間に亘る産業別労働生産性に関する成長パターン（ダイナミクス）を、その構成要素である「付加価値」（アウトプット）と「労働投入」（インプット）の変動に分解して描写する。本稿での主たる発見は以下の通りである。第一に、日本の非製造業における近年の低労働生産性水準は、労働投入の減少ではカバー出来ない付加価値の低下を主因として生じている。第二に、製造業の幾つかの業種では、これらの両要素に関する多様な変動を通じて労働生産性の成長を実現している。第三に、これらの結果を他国の産業別労働生産性水準でベンチマークした場合、ごく一部の業種（例：対事業所サービス）を除いて、ほぼ全ての日本の産業において米国に比して労働生産性水準が低下している。第四に、こうした過去20年に亘る産業別労働生産性のダイナミクスを各年毎に対前年比で記述したところ、長期のダイナミクスの背後に、短期における多様なダイナミクスが存在していることが確認された。

O49| Capacidad productiva, cambio técnico y productividad: Estimaciones alternativas del producto de largo plazo| Esta investigación presenta las estimaciones del producto de largo plazo y de la brecha del producto, correspondientes a dos enfoques teóricos. El primero es el enfoque del crecimiento dirigido por la demanda. Se estiman dos modelos de producción de largo plazo. El modelo de Shaikh y Moudud (2004) con una ligera modificación para captar el cambio técnico determinado por la demanda en el sentido Kaldoriano (Kaldor, 1957); y, el modelo de Thirlwall (1979) según el cual las tasas teóricas de crecimiento de largo plazo de la economía están determinadas, en el largo plazo, por las tasas de crecimiento de las exportaciones. El segundo enfoque es el neoclásico de Solow-Swan (1956). Este enfoque sostiene que el crecimiento de largo plazo está limitado por factores de oferta y, entre estos se encuentran ciertamente los factores de producción capital y trabajo. Se utiliza la misma técnica de cointegración para estimar los modelos de ambos enfoques para de este modo facilitar su comparación. JEL Classification-JEL: E12 , E13 , E23 , O11 , O40 , O47 , O49
O49|Los efectos de la crisis económica en Galicia a través de 25 cuadros<BR>[The effects of the economic crisis in Galicia through 25 graphs]|Eleven years have passed since the beginning of the economic crisis that began in 2008 when two consecutive quarters of negative quarter-on-quarter variation rates were experienced. Throughout these eleven years, three key moments can be highlighted, which are the ones taken as a general reference: the second quarter of 2008, when the economic crisis begins; the fourth quarter of 2013, when the Galician economy begins its economic recovery; and the third quarter of 2017, when the pre-crisis level is achieved in terms of real GDP. The purpose of this paper is to offer, in a synthetic way, an image of the effects of the economic crisis from the data collected in the following graphs and tables
O49|Wachstumsfolgen von Einkommensungleichheit – Theorie, empirische Evidenz und Politikempfehlungen|Income inequality is “the defining challenge of our time”, former US President Barack Obama said in a speech in December 2013. Undoubtedly, the financial crisis and the sluggish recovery in its aftermath have increased the attention to rising inequality. This survey addresses the consequences of income inequality for economic growth from a theoretical and from an empirical angle. Both perspectives yield inconclusive results on whether inequality is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ for growth. This poses a problem for policymakers contemplating (e.g. tax) policies aimed at raising or lowering inequality. On the other hand, policies to promote social justice arguably do not need to pass a ‘do they increase economic growth?’ test. Some policy proposals which would reduce inequality are discussed as well.
O49|Automatisierung, Wachstum und Ungleichheit|Die Automatisierung stellt eines der wichtigsten Phänomene dar, welche aktuell innerhalb der Wirtschaftswissenschaften und der breiteren Öffentlichkeit diskutiert werden. Dabei finden sich in Bezug auf die Frage, wie sich die Automatisierung gesamtwirtschaftlich auswirkt, sehr unterschiedliche Positionen: Am einen Ende wird auf die negativen Beschäftigungseffekte verwiesen, wenn Menschen mehr und mehr durch Maschinen ersetzt werden und ihre am Markt angebotene Arbeitsleistung nicht mehr nachgefragt somit obsolet wird. Gleichzeitig wird die Automatisierung auch für einen Anstieg der wirtschaftlichen Ungleichheit verantwortlich gemacht. Optimistischere Stimmen verweisen andererseits auf die Entwicklung seit der Industriellen Revolution, die durch fortlaufende technologische Veränderungen mit hohem Produktivitätswachstum und damit starken Wohlfahrtssteigerungen einherging, ohne dass es langfristig zu Massenarbeitslosigkeit gekommen ist. Der vorliegende Aufsatz diskutiert einige allgemein relevante empirische Daten und skizziert ein einfaches theoretisches Wachstumsmodell zur Analyse der Automatisierung. Die hierbei festgehaltenen Ergebnisse werden unter Bezugnahme auf die aktuelle wirtschaftswissenschaftliche Literatur zu den bisherigen und für die Zukunft zu erwartenden ökonomischen Effekten der Automatisierung vertieft und erweitert. Aus den verschiedenen Ansatzpunkten und Überlegungen werden schließlich wirtschaftspolitische Handlungsmöglichkeiten abgeleitet, wobei auch jeweils diskutiert wird, welchen Einschränkungen diese Maßnahmen unterliegen.
O49|Crecimiento económico y pobreza en las regiones y en los sectores económicos de Perú|Se estudia la relación entre el crecimiento económico y la pobreza monetaria en el Perú a nivel de sectores económicos y regiones geográficas. Se muestran evidencias que sustentan la hipótesis de que el crecimiento económico ha tenido una contribución relevante en la reducción de la pobreza entre 2004 y 2016, siendo esta contribución heterogénea en las regiones y sectores económicos considerados. En promedio el crecimiento económico ha sido pro-pobre a nivel nacional, aunque en algunas regiones no se puede afirmar lo mismo. Finalmente, hay evidencias que sugieren que en las regiones con mayor desigualdad en la distribución del ingreso el crecimiento económico es menos eficiente en reducir la pobreza.

O49|Optimal Versus Sustainable Degrowth Policies|This paper introduces a natural resource and pollution in a Ramsey growth model which relies on the postulates of ecological economics. It studies the impact of voluntary degrowth policies on production and welfare. The instrument of these policies is a tax on the natural resource. These public policies are implemented after the downturn of the households' welfare following from the increased pollution.
O49|“Thirlwall’s Law” reconsidered|Abstract Thirlwall’s Law is found to be the necessary but not sufficient condition for balanced long-run growth. A simple equation is considered whose empirical analysis could confirm—or reject—the validity of the Law. The analysis, conducted by means of econometric co-integration using the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares method applied to data for 59 countries covering the years 1960–2012, suggests that Thirlwall’s Law may not hold for the decisive majority of countries.
O49|Impact of Fukushima Nuclear Disaster on Oil-Consuming Sectors of Japan|The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was an accident at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant in Fukushima, Japan, which resulted primarily from the tsunami following the Tohoku earthquake on 11 March 2011, and which led to a year-long nuclear shutdown in the country. During the shutdown, Japan substituted fossil fuels for nuclear power and became more dependent on the import and consumption of fossil fuels including oil, gas, and coal. We try to shed light on the elasticity of oil consumption to crude oil price before and after the Fukushima disaster in Japan’s various economic sectors. To do so, we apply a cointegration analysis and perform a vector error correction (VEC) variance decomposition by using quarterly data in two separate subperiods from Q1 1981 to Q4 2010 and from Q1 2011 to Q4 2015. Our findings reveal that the absolute value of elasticities of oil consumption by some economic sectors, such as the industry, non-energy, and transportation sectors to oil prices, was reduced after the disaster because of increased dependency on oil consumption, which endangered energy security in the country. To raise energy self-dependency and energy security, Japan needs to diversify its energy supply resources. For instance, the share of renewable energy in Japan’s energy basket needs to increase. Because renewable energy projects are mainly considered risky and banks are reluctant to finance them, we introduce an innovative form of financing these projects: Hometown Investment Trust Funds, which has been introduced and applied in Japan and other parts of Asia.
O49|Моделирование показателя стагнирующей экономики. Indicator simulation of a stagnating economy|На протяжении последних десятилетий экономики развитых стран периодически подвергаются кризисам и стагнациям. На развитие стагнации влияет не только застой в сфере промышленного производства, но и проблемы в сфере трудовых ресурсов и при создании человеческого капитала. Основными инструментами преодоления стагнации является государственная финансовая и нормативно-правовая поддержка. Цель работы – получение системы дифференциальных уравнений, которая описывает изменение скорости обновления возобновляемых факторов производства и производительности экономики при вхождении в кризисы и в состоянии стагнации. Анализ поведения факторов производства производится с использованием векторного анализа. Получено неравенство, удовлетворение которого дает условия выхода экономики из стагнации. Полученное векторное неравенство показывает, что для выхода экономики из стагнации очень важна скорость реакции на потребности в инвестировании возобновляемых факторов производства. Производственные факторы тесно взаимосвязаны, поэтому преодоление явлений стагнации в одном из факторов не дает гарантии роста всей экономики. In recent decades the economies of developed countries were periodically exposed to crises and stagnation. Not only the depression of industrial production affects the development of stagnation, but also the problems in the labor force as well as the issues with creation of human capital. State’s financial and regulatory support are the main tools to overcome stagnation. The aim of this work is to obtain a system of differential equations that describes the change of the update rate of renewable factors of production and productivity in the economy at the approach to the state of stagnation. The papers studies the behavior of factors of production using vector analysis. The author obtained the inequality, which gives the conditions of overcoming the economic stagnation. This inequality shows that the rate of response to the need for investment has more impact on overcoming stagnation than the volume of investments. Production factors are closely interrelated; therefore, overcoming the phenomenon of stagnation in one of the factors does not guarantee the growth of the entire economy.
O49|Migration and (Macro) Economic Risksâ€“Romania s Case|Migration is one of the predominant phenomena in debating core issues of politics, economy and society at the beginning of the 21st century. In order to understand the complexity of this phenomenon, it is necessary to investigate its main determinants that maintained from historical perspective some of the characteristics from the beginning of the 20th century; however, at increased complexity, in the context of constant changes of geopolitical and economic regional configurations. The European enlargement towards the central and eastern part of the continent brought about also changes regarding increased demographic and economic risks in the absence of global migration governance, but also due to the frailty of national institutions in the field of migration and labor market. The paper intends to briefly enumerate main (macro)economic and demographic risks for Romania by underpinning the contribution of institutional factors to improving the management of this phenomenon at national level.
O49|Is potential output growth falling?|We estimate the rate of growth consistent with a stable unemployment rate for four advanced economies (Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States) using a Heckman-type two step estimation procedure that deals with the issue of endogenous regressors in a time-varying parameter model. The results show that this rate of growth of potential output has been falling in the four countries of study, so that these countries have been systematically loosing capacity to grow during the postwar era.
O49|Tourism satellite account – basic innovation|The paper presents review and systematisation of specificities of use of the Tourism Satellite Account,developed by the international tourism organizations as a statistical tool for tourism sector analysis and for determining the influence of tourism upon economies of separate countries and the world economy as a whole. Analytical review of the concept and summary of the suggestions of the Tourism Satellite Account: Recommended Methodological Framework – 2008 for concordance of data on demand and supply in tourism are made. Problems related to the implementation of the National Satellite Accounts in Europe are analysed. Tendencies in the development of the tourism sector in Bulgaria in the period2008-2013 are analysed and assessed upon data of the National Statistical Institute and the World Travel and Tourism Council.
O49|A comparative assessment of the Bulgarian economic competitiveness|The paper provides an economic interpretation of the assessments of the level of competitiveness of the Bulgarian economy presented in official international studies. The key factors for the competitiveness of the Bulgarian economy have been analyzed. They are ranked in comparison with other countries. The dynamics of these factors are traced before and after the economic crisis. Special attention is paid to the impact of the geoeconomic factor on the comparative economic competitiveness – what is the geoeconomics specificity and what impact has on the economic development of Bulgaria. Some conclusions about the Bulgarian competitiveness are made based on the results of the study; pointing out certain opportunities for increase.
O49|The Outlook for U.S. Production of Shale Oil: Working Paper 2016-01|This paper describes an approach to modeling U.S. production of energy from shale resources and the outlook for that production. Production is insensitive to the price of oil in the short run but quite responsive within two to three years.
O49|Crecimiento económico colombiano y quiebres estructurales endógenos|Este documento explora mediante pruebas de cambio estructural endógeno, posibles quiebres en la distribución no condicional del crecimiento del PIB real colombiano entre 1924 y 2013. No se encuentra evidencia de algún quiebre estructural en la tasa de crecimiento económico durante el periodo analizado, contradiciendo previos hallazgos de la literatura académica colombiana. Para la serie en niveles del logaritmo del PIB real se obtiene evidencia de tres cambios estructurales en la tendencia, en los años 1942, 1972 y 1999. El último podría asociarse con reformas económicas, en términos de apertura de las cuentas real y financiera de la economía colombiana. Se comparan las estimaciones con la situación para otros 16 países de la región. En este caso, a diferencia del colombiano, los resultados apuntan a la presencia de quiebres a finales de la década de los 70, durante la década de los 80, y a principios de los 90 para algunos países de la región.
O49|The Recent Growth Resurgence in Africa and Poverty Reduction: Assessing the Context and Evidence|While economic growth in Africa has resurged substantially since the mid-to-late 1990s, the amount of poverty reduction seems much less spectacular. Building on other studies, the paper explores the translation of the recent growth to poverty reduction using 1985-2013 PovcalNet (World Bank) data. It assesses the relative abilities of various panel-data methodologies to predict poverty changes based on income-inequality decompositions. Surprisingly, SYSGMM performs substantially worse than Fixed Effects and Random Effects. The analysis is conducted for both the $1.25 and $2.00 poverty lines, and for the ‘spread’ and ‘depth’ of poverty, as well as for the usual popular measure, the headcount ratio. Although income growth appears to be the main force behind poverty reduction in Africa, the decomposition reveals striking differences across countries with respect to the relative roles of inequality and income.
O49|Un modèle de décroissance optimale|Dans le cadre d'un modèle de croissance à la Ramsey avec ressource naturelle et pollution et reposant sur certains postulats de l'économie écologique, ce papier étudie les effets de politiques de décroissance volontaire sur la production et le bien-être. L'instrument de ces politiques est une taxe prélevée sur la ressource naturelle. Ces politiques sont appliquées par les pouvoirs publics suite au retournement de la fonction d'utilité des ménages induit par l'augmentation de la pollution. Par rapport à la situation de laisser-faire, leur résultat est à la fois de réduire la production et la pollution d'une part, et d'accroître le bien-être d'autre part. Une réaction plus tardive des autorités publiques suite au retournement de la fonction d'utilité des ménages implique que la taxation de la ressource naturelle doit être plus élevée pendant les premières périodes. Si la préférence pour le futur des autorités est plus grande, alors les gains d'utilité dus à la politique de décroissance sont moindres pour les premières générations de la dynastie et supérieurs pour les suivantes. L'impact du progrès technique économisant la ressource ou améliorant le traitement de la pollution est également analysé. With the help of a growth model à la Ramsey with a natural resource and pollution and relying on postulates of ecological economics, this paper studies the impact of voluntary degrowth policies on production and welfare. The instrument of these policies is a tax levied on the natural resource. These policies are assumed to be applied by the public authorities after the downturn of the households'utility function due to the increase of pollution. With respect to the laisser-faire situation, their impact is to simultaneously decrease production and pollution on the one hand and increase welfare on the other. A delayed reaction of the public authorities after the turnover of the households'utility function implies a higher tax rate on the resource during the first periods. If the authorities'preference for the future is higher, then welfare gains from the degrowth policy are lower for the first generations of the dynasty and higher for the later. The impact of technical progress saving the resource or improving the pollution treatment is also analysed.
O49|CO2 emission and economic growth in Algeria|Algeria is one of the most important CO2 emitters among developing countries and the third among African countries. It pledged to curb carbon emissions by at least 7% by 2030. However, complying with this target may be a difficult task without compromising economic growth. The aim of this paper is to analyze the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth in Algeria, taking into account energy use, electricity consumption, exports and imports. The validity of the EKC hypothesis, throughout the period from 1970 to 2010, is tested by using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag model extended to introduce the break points. Results confirm the EKC for Algeria. Nevertheless, the turning point is reached for a very high GDP per capita value, indicating that economic growth in Algeria will continue to increase emissions. Results also indicate that an increase in energy use and electricity consumption increase CO2 emissions, and that exports and imports affect them negatively and positively, respectively. Therefore, it is necessary to promote renewable energies and energy efficiency policies. Regulatory reforms are needed to facilitate foreign investments with which to carry out these policies. Likewise, it may be appropriate to decrease subsides in energy prices to encourage energy efficiency.
O49|On lessons from energy and environmental cost–benefit analysis|This short paper introduces a few concepts from environmental, energy, and health economics that may be useful in evaluations of infrastructure investment in R&D. These concepts focus on valuing commodities and resource stocks under uncertainty. In particular, households may value a commodity (or a resource stock or a species) even if they never will consume the commodity. This may also be true for services generated by R&D infrastructure. Similarly, there are existence values, i.e., a household may be willing to pay for the saving of an endangered species. This may also be true for some R&D infrastructure, i.e., they may be classified as a (world) heritage. They also generate new medical treatments saving lives as well as curing non-fatal diseases. Health and environmental economists have since long dealt with the valuation of such benefits.

O49|The Swedish National Innovation Council: Innovation policy governance to replace linearity with holism|The Swedish National Innovation Council (NIC) was created by the Prime Minister (Stefan Löfven) in February 2015, and it has now been operating for 18 months. It is personally chaired by the Prime Minister, which is unusual for such councils in other countries. Another atypical characteristic of the Swedish NIC is its dominant and wide focus on innovation rather than on research (for which there is another council in Sweden). The existence of NIC has given innovation policy issues a much higher status and degree of importance both within the government itself and within government agencies, i.e. in the entire state apparatus. NIC has become a major governance instrument in order to transform Swedish innovation policy from being linear towards becoming holistic. The continued separation between innovation policy and research policy is also very important if the linear view shall lose its dominance in the field of innovation policy. The Swedish NIC will be described and analyzed in this paper and its operation will be exemplified by four types of NIC activity. I will show that two of these activities have already been directly successful in influencing innovation policy in practice (state risk capital provision and innovation-related public procurement) and that an interesting development has been taking place in the other two (holistic innovation policy and additionality). These examples will be placed within a framework of the relevant innovation theory and of the development of innovation policy in a larger context.
O49|The chronic food deficit of early modern Portugal: curse or myth?|Two historiographical currents have debated whether early modern Portugal was cursed by an excessive dependence on foreign food imports as a result of being unable to feed its population, or not. In this short paper, the first long-run systematic quantitative study of this question, we show that the former view is a myth and therefore could not be a curse. Throughout the entire period, a certain amount of grain was in fact imported but cereal purchases abroad never represented more than a diminutive percentage of total food consumption. More importantly, the country carried out a diversified trade in foodstuffs which was seldom seriously out of balance. Portuguese agriculture showed itself consistently capable of specializing in different foodstuffs for export. It was thus not hopelessly inefficient and succeeded reasonably well in meeting the basic nutritional needs of the population.
O49|Does Health Matter for Economic Growth?|This paper reviewed extensive theoretical and empirical studies which emphasize the role human capital in form of health, in economic growth. Most of the studies used proxies like life expectancy, infant mortality rate and health expenditure to estimate the effects of health on economic growth. Majority of the studies agree the positive impact of health on the economic growth and suggest investment in health to achieve sustained economic growth.
O49|Costs, Capabilities, Conflict and Cash: The Problem of Technology and Sustainable Economic Growth in Pakistan|Growth in Pakistan has been surprisingly sustainable. GDP growth of 5 percent p.a. since independence and no recession since (at least) 1960 according to World Bank data represents a creditable performance when compared to all but the most successful developing countries. Pakistan has significantly transformed the structure of its economy during these same decades; in 1950 99 percent of its exports were agricultural goods and by the 1990s exports were largely manufactured goods. This very success indicates a growing constraint on sustaining growth into the future or the concern that Pakistan may be headed for a Middle Income Trap. Although there does exist scope for continued growth based on further structural changes - in particular the large number of people still employed in agriculture or the women not currently engaged in the labor force - for growth to be sustained a more intensive or productivity-oriented growth will be necessary. This paper first outlines the importance of productivity growth for sustaining GDP growth in Pakistan, then examines the historical and comparative productivity performance of Pakistan, and explores a number of case studies of successful technological change, particularly in South Asia, and finally attempts to draw some lessons for contemporary Pakistan.
O49|Threshold effects of fiscal policy on economic growth in developing countries|We examine the relation between fiscal policy and economic growth for a panel of 40 developing countries over the period of 1990 to 2012 using eight macroeconomic variables: real GDP, budget deficit, current government spending, national saving, inflation rate, total investment, public debt, and current account balance. The study documents a double threshold effect of the fiscal balance. The first one is at a level of the deficit around 4.8% of GDP; the second one is at the fiscal surplus level of 3.2% of GDP meaning that economic growth would be negatively affected when exceeding these two different levels. The result also show that the sign of the relation between budget deficit and economic growth is conditioned by the level of total investment i.e. only for total investment higher than 23%, there exists a positive relation. However, it becomes negative, when investment falls below this threshold.
O49|Threshold Effects of Fiscal Policy on Economic Activity in Developing Countries|The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between fiscal policy and economic growth for a panel of 40 developing countries for the period 1990 â€“ 2012 with a focus on a comparative analysis between Morocco and the panel. The variables used are real GDP, budget deficit, current government spending, national saving, inflation rate, total investment, public debt and current account balance. The main findings are: First, there is evidence of a double threshold effect of the fiscal balance. When exceeding a budget deficit level of 4.8% of GDP or a fiscal surplus level of 3.2% of GDP, economic growth is negatively affected. Second, the sign of the relationship between budget deficit and economic growth is conditioned by the level of total investment. For values of total investment higher than 23%, it follows that there is a positive relationship. However, it becomes negative, when investment falls below this threshold. Third, from Moroccoâ€™s perspective, analysis of threshold effects suggested that above 4.8% of budget deficit, average growth rate falls by 2.1%, while median growth falls by 1.5%.
O49|Has Trade Been Driving Global Economic Growth?|Abstract The last 50 years have produced a series of revolutionary technological changes. These decades have also witnessed a truly revolutionary systemic change at the global level. The change started with step-wise internal liberalisations and deregulations in the major industrialised countries. The internal systemic changes have been synchronised with the consecutive waves of liberalisation of international economic relations. Trade liberalisations (cuts in tariff levels, progressive removal of many non-tariff barriers to trade) were followed by consecutive waves of liberalisation of capital flows to a large degree completing the process of globalisation. Advancing globalisation seems to have been paralleled by the global economic growth becoming progressively slower and unstable. Using the standard tools of time series econometrics (VEC, Granger non-causality testing, ARDL) the paper suggests that trade has not been driving global economic growth (or even that expanding trade may have slowed down global output growth). Large and persistent trade imbalances which have become typical since the mid-1970s are just one possible reason for trade no longer playing the positive role assigned to it in the trade theories. The second reason relates to the ‘race-to-the-bottom’ tendencies with respect to the wage rate which have developed under globalisation. These tendencies may have been responsible for the persistent shortage of aggregate demand at the global level and – consequently – weakening global output growth.
O49|Population Diversity, Division of Labor and Comparative Development|This research explores the emergence and prevalence of economic specialization and trade in pre-modern societies. It advances the hypothesis, and establishes empirically that population diversity had a positive causal effect on economic specialization and trade. Based on a novel ethnic level dataset combining geocoded ethnographic, linguistic and genetic data, this research exploits the exogenous variation in population diversity generated by the ``Out-of-Africa'' migration of anatomically modern humans to causally establish that higher levels of population diversity were conducive to economic specialization and the emergence of trade-related institutions that, in turn, translated into pre-modern era differences in comparative development. Additionally, this research provides suggestive evidence that regions historically inhabited by pre-modern societies with high levels of economic specialization have higher levels of contemporary occupational heterogeneity, economic complexity and development.
O49|Nightlights as a Development Indicator: The Estimation of Gross Provincial Product (GPP) in Turkey|For a while in Turkey, researchers dealing with spatial economics are unable to make detailed comparative and descriptive analysis on sub-national base due to lack of data. In particular, GDP, which is a basic indicator of economic activities, has not been published in Turkey at sub-national level since 2001. In this study, we use a different data source, night-time satellite imagery, to obtain sub-national GDP and GDP per capita series for the period between 2001 and 2013 at the level of provinces which is the basic administrative division of the Country. We also re-construct the series for the period between 1992 and 2001. For the estimation of sub-national GDP, we use Neural Network Algorithm.
O49|The paradox of thrift in an inegalitarian neoclassical economy|" Schilcht (1975) and Bourguignon (1981) studied the case of a convex saving function in the Stiglitz (1969) model. They have shown that if one of the two proportions of the rich or the poor is below a certain threshold, there is a two-class equilibrium. However, they have only proved the existence of this threshold. We give here a system of equations to calculate this threshold which we interpret as the maximum proportion of rich for having a stable two-class configuration. If the proportion of rich exceeds this threshold, the economy enters a phase of decline although the golden-rule capital has not yet been reached. The mechanism of this decline recalls the description given in Keynes (1936), of the decline which happens when there is too much savings in an inegalitarian context. This is an example of what is known as the ""paradox of thrift"". It is remarkable that this paradox takes place in a neoclassical setting that does not include key Keynesian elements such as saturation of demand, monetization of savings, short-term effects, expectation problems, involuntary unemployment and rigidities. Numerical simulations are given to illustrate and analyze the mechanisms involved."
O49|The paradox of thrift in an inegalitarian neoclassical economy|"Schilcht (1975) and Bourguignon (1981) studied the case of a convex saving function in the Stiglitz (1969) model. They have shown that if one of the two proportions of the rich or the poor is below a certain threshold, there is a two-class equilibrium. However, they have only proved the existence of this threshold. We give here a system of equations to calculate this threshold which we interpret as the maximum proportion of rich for having a stable two-class configuration. If the proportion of rich exceeds this threshold, the economy enters a phase of decline although the golden-rule capital has not yet been reached. The mechanism of this decline recalls the description given in Keynes (1936), of the decline which happens when there is too much savings in an inegalitarian context. This is an example of what is known as the ""paradox of thrift"".

O49|La Dette Exterieure Handicape T’Elle La Croissance Economique Du Togo ?<BR>[Is External Debt A Brake On Togo’S Economic Growth?]|The purposes of this paper are to investigate empirically the impact of external debt on Togo’s economic growth with a model that relies on a log-quadratic function and to test the causality between that external debt and the economic growth. The empirical methodology is based on the autoregressive distributed lag approach (ARDL) suggested by Mohammad H. Pesaran and al. (2001), on the cointegration and with Toda and Yamamoto (1995) causality tests. The data cover the period 1971-2014. The results obtained indicate that the impact of external debt on economic growth in the long-run is positive and significant. The results show also the existence of causality, from external debt to economic growth according to Toda and Yamamoto.
O49|Analyse Du Lien Entre Les Emissions De Co2, Leur Restriction Et La Croissance Economique Du Togo<BR>[Analysis Of The Nexus Between Co2 Emission, Their Restriction And Economic Growth Of Togo]|The purposes of this paper are to investigate empirically the impact of carbon dioxide emission and its restriction on Togo’s economic growth with a model that relies on a STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology) suggested by Ehrlich and Holden (1971; 1972) modified, augmented with the restriction of carbon dioxide emission, and to test the causality between that emission and the economic growth. The empirical methodology is based on the autoregressive distributed lag approach suggested by Mohammad H. Pesaran and al. (2001) and on the cointegration and Toda and Yamamoto’s causality tests. The data cover the period 1960-2011. The results obtained indicate that the impact of carbon dioxide emission on Togo’s economic growth in the long-run is positive and significant. The results show also the existence of causality between carbon dioxide emission and economic growth according to Toda and Yamamoto and significant. Besides, the results indicate that the restriction of carbon dioxide emission by Togo compared with Benin in the long-run is negative and significant, while that restriction compared with Ghana’s is positive and significant on Togo’s economic growth. The results reveal also that Togo undertakes fewer efforts in reduction of carbon dioxide emission compared with Benin but more efforts compared with Ghana.
O49|Volatility and Growth with Recursive Preferences|This paper studies the relationship between volatility and long-run growth in a complete market economy with human capital accumulation and Epstein-Zin preferences. There is both crosscountry and time-series evidence that volatility is associated with lower growth. Matching this evidence has proved a challenge for growth models with no market failures as they tend to predict the opposite for values of risk aversion higher than unity. However in our model, risk aversion and intertemporal elasticity of substitution are allowed to move independently of each other, and when both are relatively high or relatively low, the relationship between volatility and growth is negative. Indeed this is the case for parametrizations of preferences in line with the literature.
O49|Afterthoughts on urban economic theory and its focus|An interesting part of the present scientific debate in urban economics concerns the appropriateness of some theoretical —and consequently empirical— definitions of the city and its role, underlining the reductive character of purely functional approaches in terms of agglomeration economies. Many scientific achievements have been attained exploiting the virtues of these approaches, residing in their strong internal consistency (within their logical assumptions) and sophisticated formalization. What appears to be left is the inspection of the true nature of cities, going far beyond their agglomerated physical form and the consequent benefits on transactions and communications. The paper suggests that the geographical-functional approach should be complemented by two other approaches, implicit in classical economics and in evolutionary economic theory, which allow the inspection and (perhaps) a proper interpretation of other constituents of the nature of cities: what I call the relational-cognitive approach —interpreting the city as a cognitive milieu, generating knowledge, creativity and innovation— and the hierarchical-distributive one, interpreting the relationships with the non-city, the «countryside» of classical economists, in terms of control and monopolistic determination of relative prices. The former approach looks at the intrinsically generative role of the city and its capability of developing continuously new activities and functions; the latter at power relations on space and control on income distribution. If the functional approach looks nowadays quite consolidated, the cognitive one needs still in depth reflections, as it implies the (at least partial) abandonment of methodological individualism that permeates neoclassical economics, with the advantage of better utilizing the conceptual achievements of other social disciplines. On the other hand, the hierarchical and distributive approach looks today quite unexplored. At the end, a tentative, formalized model of agglomeration economies is presented, with the goal of stimulating the attention on the empirical measurement of the effects of the cognitive and control roles of the city. Two main open issues emerge, both referring to income distribution: how are the advantages of increasing returns to urban scale being distributed among the internal production factors (and urban social classes, including land owners) and how could we measure the urban power in terms of income distribution in space.

O49|Population Diversity, Division of Labor and Comparative Development|This research explores the emergence and prevalence of economic specialization and trade in pre-modern societies. It advances the hypothesis, and establishes empirically that population diversity had a positive causal effect on economic specialization and trade. Based on a novel ethnic level dataset combining geocoded ethnographic, linguistic and genetic data, this research exploits the exogenous variation in population diversity generated by the ``Out-of-Africa'' migration of anatomically modern humans to causally establish that higher levels of population diversity were conducive to economic specialization and the emergence of trade-related institutions that, in turn, translated into pre-modern era differences in comparative development. Additionally, this research provides suggestive evidence that regions historically inhabited by pre-modern societies with high levels of economic specialization have higher levels of contemporary occupational heterogeneity, economic complexity and development.
O49|Labour productivity convergence and structural changes: simultaneous analysis at country, regional and industry levels|Abstract Many structural changes have occurred in the European Union countries, for example, there have been changes in sectoral employment share, in the demand of goods due to technology, in trade patterns and in technology. These structural changes may affect the process of convergence. Most of the existing studies on convergence have ignored the role of structural change, which may have resulted in different conclusion. This study considers the role of structural change in testing labour productivity convergence and its speed at the country, region and industry levels simultaneously. The results show that conditional convergence exists at country, regional and industry levels. However, speed of convergence is different across different aggregation levels. Convergence speed at the regional levels is faster than at the country and industry levels. Furthermore, if we do not incorporate structural change, convergence speed may be over- or underestimated.
O49|Has trade been driving global economic growth?|The last 50 years have produced a series of revolutionary technological changes. These decades have also witnessed a truly revolutionary systemic change at the global level. The change started with step-wise internal liberalisations and deregulations in the major industrialised countries. The internal systemic changes have been synchronised with the consecutive waves of liberalisation of international economic relations. Advancing globalisation has been paralleled by the global economic growth becoming progressively slower and unstable. Using the standard tools of time series econometrics (VEC,Granger non-causality testing, ARDL) the paper suggests that trade has not been driving global economic growth (or even that expanding trade may have slowed down global output growth). Large and persistent trade imbalances which have become typical since the mid- 1970s are just one possible reason for trade no longer playing the positive role assigned to it in the trade theories. The second reason relates to the ‘race-to-thebottom’ tendencies with respect to the wage rate which have developed under globalisation. These tendencies may have been responsible for the persistent shortage of aggregate demand at the global level and – consequently – weakening global output growth.

O49|Propuesta de un modelo para el desarrollo de un ecosistema de innovaciÃ³n para el Estado de QuerÃ©taro|A partir de la dinÃ¡mica econÃ³mica y social dada por un proceso de globalizaciÃ³n continuo, que se ha presentado en las Ãºltimas dÃ©cadas, los paÃ­ses se han visto obligados a desarrollar y ofrecer procesos, productos y servicios innovadores para poder competir y satisfacer las necesidades del mercado. Los enfoques a travÃ©s de los cuales se evalÃºa el desempeÃ±o de los diferentes paÃ­ses que conforman el orbe, cambian con la misma dinÃ¡mica con que las naciones y sus esquemas productivos y culturales lo hacen. Entre los factores que se han seÃ±alado continuamente como impulsores del crecimiento de paÃ­ses como China, India, JapÃ³n, Corea y Chile, por mencionar algunos, destacan la educaciÃ³n, la innovaciÃ³n y la inversiÃ³n. El presente estudio tiene como objetivo analizar el contexto, en alcances internacional y nacional, de los diferentes factores relacionados con el nivel de competitividad de las economÃ­as del mundo, a travÃ©s de modelos propuestos por el Foro EconÃ³mico Mundial (World Economic Forum, WEF por sus siglas en inglÃ©s) y las mÃ©tricas que el mismo foro propone para medir dicha competitividad y plantear con ello, una idea para medir el estado que guarda la cultura de innovaciÃ³n a partir de un ecosistema de innovaciÃ³n en el Estado de QuerÃ©taro, con lo que se pudieron identificar oportunidades en diversos contextos para su fomento From the economic, commercial, social and business dynamics, given by a continuous process of globalization that has occurred in recent decades, countries have been forced to develop and offer processes, products and innovative services to compete and meet market needs. The approaches through which the performance of the different countries of the globe is evaluated with the same dynamics change with nations and their productive and cultural patterns do. Among the factors that have been identified continuously, as drivers of growth, countries like China, India, Japan, Korea, Chile, to name a few, include education, innovation and investment. The present study aims firstly to analyze the context, internationally and nationally, of different factors related to the competitiveness of the economies of the world so in the first instance the models proposed by the World Economic Forum was revised (World Economic Forum, WEF for its acronym in English) and metrics to the same forum that aims to measure competitiveness, in order to propose a system that holds the culture of innovation from an ecosistema in the State of Queretaro, which is able to identify opportunities in various contexts for promotion.
O49|Dinámica tecnológica internacional de los sectores productivos: un análisis empírico|Se propone una nueva metodología para evaluar las oportunidades de desarrollo económico asociadas a la presencia de las diversas industrias en la estructura económica de un país. Con tal propósito, se reinterpretan las herramientas de la literatura del “espacio de producto” a partir de conceptos neoschumpeterianos, procurando evaluar la sofisticación y transversalidad tecnológica de los sectores productivos, a objeto de caracterizar el actual paradigma tecnoproductivo y el papel de los diversos sectores en este. Mediante el trabajo con datos de exportaciones de 113 países y territorios en el período 2005-2009, se concluye que los “sectores clave” en la economía mundial son “Maquinaria Industrial”, “Instrumentos Científicos y Médicos” y “Farmacéutica”. Empero, los buenos resultados mostrados por sectores basados en tecnologías maduras sugieren la hipótesis de la sobrevivencia y superposición de sectores clave de diferentes etapas históricas —en una suerte de capas geológicas— debido a la persistencia de los sistemas tecnológicos previos.
O49|The dynamics of economic growth, oil prices, stock market depth, and other macroeconomic variables: Evidence from the G-20 countries|This paper examines the linkages between economic growth, oil prices, depth in the stock market, and three other key macroeconomic indicators: real effective exchange rate, inflation rate, and real rate of interest. We employ a panel vector autoregressive model to test Granger causality for the G-20 countries over the period 1961–2012. A novel approach to this study is that we clearly demarcate the long-run and short-run relations between the economic variables. The results show a robust long-run economic relationship between economic growth, oil prices, stock market depth, real effective exchange rate, inflation rate, and real rate of interest. In the long run, real economic growth is found to respond to any deviation in the long-run equilibrium relationship that is found to exist between the different measures of stock market depth, oil prices, and the other macroeconomic variables. In the short run we find a complex network of causal relationships between the variables. While the empirical evidence of short-run causality is mixed, there is clear evidence that real economic growth responds to various measures of stock market depth, allowing for real oil price movements and changes in the real effective exchange rate, inflation rate, and real rate of interest.
O49|Growth, Growth Accelerations, and the Poor: Lessons from Indonesia|We study the impact of growth and growth accelerations on poverty and inequality in Indonesia using a new panel dataset covering 26 provinces over the period 1977–2010. This dataset allows us to distinguish between mining and non-mining in Indonesia. Growth in non-mining significantly reduces poverty and inequality. In contrast, overall growth and growth in mining appears to have no effect on the same. Growth acceleration in non-mining reduces poverty and inequality whereas the same in mining increases poverty. We expect that the degree of forward and backward linkages of mining and non-mining sectors explains the asymmetric result.
O49|The Innovation Union Scoreboard is Flawed: The case of Sweden – not being the innovation leader of the EU|According to the Innovation Union Scoreboard, published by the European Commission every year, Sweden has been, and still is, an innovation leader within the EU and one of the most innovative countries in Europe. In the Innovation Union Scoreboard 2014 (European Union, 2014: 5), Sweden has the top position (ranked number 1) of all EU28 Member States in what is called “EU Member States’ Innovation Performance”. In the ranking there are 10 countries between Sweden and the EU average. This analysis is based on the ranking provided by one single composite indicator (SII or Summary Innovation Index), based on 25 separate indicators. In this paper we argue that the SII provided by the Innovation Union Scoreboard is highly misleading. The data (the 25 separate indicators) that constitute this composite innovation indicator need to be analyzed much more in depth in order to reach a correct measure of the performance of an innovation system. We argue that input and output indicators need to be considered separately and measured individually and as two groups of indicators. Thereafter we compare the input and output indicators with one another (as is normally done in productivity and efficiency measurements). The outcome of this is a relevant and better measure of innovation performance. In this paper, the performance of the Swedish national innovation system is analyzed by using exactly the same data as is used by the Innovation Union Scoreboard 2014. We analyze the relative position of Sweden regarding both input and output indicators, concluding that Sweden’s position as an innovation leader within the EU must be reconsidered. A theoretical background and reasons for selecting the indicators used is given and a new position regarding Sweden’s innovation performance compared to the other countries is calculated. Our findings show, that Sweden remains in a high position for the innovation input indicators, ranked number 1. However, with regard to innovation output, Sweden is ranked number 10. In other words, about a third of all European Union 28 Member States have a higher innovation output than Sweden. To estimate the efficiency or productivity of the Swedish innovation system, inputs and outputs must be related to each other. When doing so, we reach the conclusion that Sweden is ranked number 24 of EU28 Member States. This finding is then discussed and we also discuss which countries would be relevant for Sweden to compare (benchmark) its innovation system with. The conclusion is that Sweden, based on our calculations, can certainly not be seen as an innovation leader in Europe. This means that the Innovation Union Scoreboard is flawed and may therefore mislead researchers, policy-makers, politicians as well as the general public – since it is widely reported in the media.
O49|The Innovation Union Scoreboard is flawed: The Case of Sweden – not the innovation leader of the EU – updated version|According to the Innovation Union Scoreboard published by the European Commission, Sweden has been, and still is, an innovation leader within the EU and one of the most innovative countries in Europe. In this paper, the performance of the Swedish national innovation system is analyzed using exactly the same data as those employed by the Innovation Union Scoreboard for the years 2014 and 2015. We argue that the Summary Innovation Index provided by the Innovation Union Scoreboard is highly misleading. Instead of merely calculating this Summary Innovation Index, the individual indicators that constitute this composite innovation indicator need to be analyzed in much greater depth in order to reach a correct measure of the performance of innovation systems. We argue that input and output indicators need to be considered as two separate types of indicators and each type should then be measured individually. Thereafter the input and output indicators should be compared to one another, as is normally done in productivity and efficiency measurements. To check whether our approach provides results similar to those of the Innovation Union Scoreboard (or not), we apply it and analyze the relative position of Sweden - appointed the innovation leader of the EU, by the EU. A theoretical background and reasons for selecting the indicators used are also given and a new position regarding Sweden’s innovation performance compared to the other EU countries is calculated. Our conclusion is that Sweden cannot be seen as an innovation leader in the EU. This means in turn that the Innovation Union Scoreboard is flawed and may therefore mislead researchers, policy-makers, politicians as well as the general public – since it is widely reported in the media.
O49|Innovation-related Public Procurement as a Demand-oriented Innovation Policy Instrument|The purpose in this paper is to show how public procurement can be a driver of innovation. The purpose and point of departure when using public procurement as an instrument of innovation policy is always to solve societal and environmental problems, to satisfy human needs or to meet global challenges. The paper is aimed at everyone who is involved or interested in public procurement, and especially in how this can promote innovation processes. Historically innovation policy has been strongly dominated by supply-push oriented instruments (measures). This linear view is actually still dominating in practical innovation policy pursued, but no longer so much in policy analysis – and certainly not among innovation researchers. In other words, the linear view is completely rejected in innovation research, but still dominates innovation policy. Innovation policy is all actions by public organizations that influence innovation processes. The choice of innovation policy instruments is a very important part of the formulation of an innovation policy. There are potentially scores, or perhaps hundreds, of innovation policy instruments to choose from. A combination of two or more instruments must often be used to solve each specific problem. They are thus combined into an “instrument mix”. Demand-based innovation policy instruments are those that influence innovation processes from the demand side. In this paper, we will very much concentrate on one kind of demand-side innovation policy instrument: innovation-related public procurement. The reason for choosing innovation-related public procurement in particular, is that it is potentially by far the most powerful kind of demand-side innovation policy instrument available. It might even potentially be the most powerful instrument among all innovation policy instruments. Public procurement of different types may affect both the speed and path of innovation development.
O49|Do intellectual property rights play a role in the economic growth of petro-states? Some empirical evidence from the GCC countries|The existing literature on the relationship between the strength of a country’s intellectual property rights and rate of growth is still inconclusive. The previous studies on IPRs and economic growth, although quite comprehensive, overlooked the resource-based economies. The role of IPRs in innovation and economic growth in the GCC is expected to be different from that in non-resource-based economies, this is because that the resource-based economies of GCC countries exhibit the characteristics of the “rentier states”. The present study contributes to the ongoing debate over the relationship between intellectual property rights (IPRs) protection and economic growth by providing new empirical evidence from the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) petro-states, namely Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait and Qatar. The present study employs the basic determinants of economic growth as postulated by various economic growth theories and then augmented with measurement of IPRs. To ensure the robustness of the empirical results, the study employs three different approaches of estimations: constant coefficient approach (ordinary least squares (OLS)), the fixed effects approach, and the between effects approach. The analyses in this study utilizes panel data from cross-sectional data on all GCC countries over a span of six years (2008 to 2013). The IPRs index used in this study was developed in 2007 by Property Rights Alliance (USA). All other explanatory variables (initial GDP per capita, inflation, human capital, population, openness, and investment) are from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (2012). The empirical findings confirm the expectations relating to “traditional” sources of economic growth. However, what is important is that the study does not find any empirical validations with respect to the role of IPRs in promoting economic growth in the GCC petro-states. The study also did not find that stronger IPRs protection in GCC countries reduces economic growth, as the variable of IPRs has a positive sign but is not statistically significant in the three specified models of the study. The insignificant relationship between IPRs and economic growth in the case of GCC countries might be related to the fact that GCC countries are “rentier states” in which IPRs per se are not sufficient to ensure technological progress and innovations. The results suggests that for IPRs to promote innovations and economic growth, a coherent set of complementary policies are required, and that the governments of the GCC countries need to play a positive role in inducing technology acquisition and creation.
O49|Economic Growth and Poverty: Spatial Regression Analysis|This article aims at introducing a spatial aspect of analyzing the relationship between economic growth and poverty, in which the geographical disparity plays an important role. A case study of growth poverty elasticity of Sumatra, Indonesia, using district-level data, is provided as an example of how spatial issues can be incorporated in the analysis. An application of spatial regression is introduced as a suitable method. The case study of Sumatra indicates that spatial influence exists in the poverty determinant model and this spatial relationship shall not be ignored in estimating GEP. Poverty incidence in Sumatra tends to be concentrated in particular locations which is influenced by spatial factors such as types of land, soil condition, transportation, and infrastructure. This suggests a poverty alleviation program should be developed targeting larger regional bases, rather than concentrating on various small areas. This method can be applied in a number of topics in agricultural economics as well as other fields relating to location factors and neighborhood influence.
O49|The Missing Economic Magic: The Failure of Trade Liberalization and Exchange Rate Devaluation in Pakistan, 1980–2012|Pakistan and India were part of that wave of economic liberalization among developing countries from the late 1980s. This paper is about one aspect of that failure to ‘produce the economic magic’, in Pakistan. Pakistan substantially liberalized its international trade after the late 1980s, and contrary to some views managed its exchange rate in an exceptionally clear sighted and prudent manner. In response, Pakistan never experienced sustained and rapid export led-growth. In fact so disappointing was the performance of exports that Pakistan’s degree of integration with the world economy was little higher in 2015 than it had been in 1990. This paper first examines the exciting promise followed by the lackluster performance of trade liberalization. It establishes evidence that the exchange rate was managed in a way that should have helped a more liberalized trading regime contribute to economic growth. The paper explores wider evidence linking trade liberalization to economic growth and argues that the positive relationship is at best only a contingent one. Those contingent factors that have failed to support the positive link between trade liberalization and economic growth in Pakistan are investment, tax revenue, and upgrading/learning.
O49|Creşterea economică a României între 1980 şi 2013<BR>[The Economic Growth of Romania between 1980 and 2013]|This paper explores the economic growth of Romania in three periods: the last decade of the communist regime (1980-1989), the transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy (1990-2006) and the seven years that followed the adhesion to European Union (2007 – 2013). We approach several aspects of the economic growth: GDP evolution, the social impact and the relations with the other macroeconomic objectives. We find, for each period, some circumstances that influenced this process: the dramatic efforts to pay back all the foreign debt, for the period 1980-1989, the political and institutional instability during the transition period and, finally, the challenges of the European markets combined with the effects of the global crisis.
O49|Human Capital-Economic Growth Nexus: A Causality Analysis for Pakistan|This paper concentrates on the role of human capital in economic growth of Pakistan during the period 1971-2012.Granger Causality test has been used as analytical technique for this purpose. The study used research and development (R&D), education and health as proxies for human capital. The results confirm the role of human capital in the economic growth of the study area. The results show that human capital in form of research and development (R&D) Granger caused economic growth during the study period. Moreover, unidirectional causal relationships exist among different levels of education, physical capital, R&D and economic growth. Realizing the significance of human capital for sustained economic growth of the country, it is suggested to increase investment in R&D, health and education sector of Pakistan.
O49|The Economy Suffer Stagnancy When Dominated With the Activities of Small Business Owners in Africa|The Paper seek to establish and bring to bear the unknown fifth factor of economic stagnancy theory, identified as a high ranked economic symptom of developing and under developed economy which contribute to poor macro-economic policy design and decision making. Furthermore; posit that such behavioural economic symptom was a contributing factor to the failure of most of the World Bank programmes in early 1980s up to date to empower the successful growth of small and medium scale enterprise in developing and under developed economy of Africa.
O49|Oil price fluctuations and oil consuming sectors: An empirical analysis of Japan|Since the oil price shocks of the 1970s, several studies have found significant impacts of oil prices on macro variables. However, it is particularly crucial to know how each micro sector in an economy, such as the residential, transport, industrial and non-energy sectors, respond to oil price impulses. In this research, we try to shed light on the impact of crude oil price volatility on each sector in Japan, the world’s third-largest crude oil consumer. In order to do so, we apply a vector auto regression model and perform impulse response analysis by using quarterly data from Q1 1990 to Q1 2014. The findings indicate that some economic sectors, such as the residential sector, did not have significant sensitivity to the sharp oil price fluctuations. In contrast, some other sectors, like the commercial, industrial, and transport sectors, were strongly sensitive to the drastic oil price fluctuations. Moreover, our findings show that after the Fukushima disaster in 2011, which led to the shutdown of nuclear power plants in Japan, because of greater reliance on oil imports, the sensitivity of most sectors to oil price volatility declined.
O49|Análisis jerárquico de la dinámica económica de las comunidades españolas en el periodo 1955-2009|El objetivo de este trabajo es estudiar la dinámica económica de las regiones de España durante el periodo 1955-2009. Para ello, introducimos dos métricas que nos permiten comparar su desempeño económico; una basada en la noción de correlación y otra en la de distancia entre series temporales. Mediante la introducción de un método no paramétrico de agrupamiento podemos detectar la formación y evolución de grupos homogéneos de desempeño. La conclusión más relevante del análisis es la existencia de dos clubs de desempeño; uno de ellos relativamente homogéneo en su dinámica de crecimiento que corresponde fundamentalmente a las regiones más ricas de España y otro más heterogéneo que engloba al resto. La dinámica de estos dos grupos ha sido completamente diferente entre sí.
O49|The role of the financial sector in enhancing economic growth in the Lao Peopleâ€™s Democratic Republic|The financial sector of the Lao Peopleâ€™s Democratic Republic has been developing rapidly in recent years in terms of financial depth, intermediation and distribution. A developed financial sector is the basis for dynamic economic growth. Yet, unsustainable financial liberalization and growth poses risks to financial sector stability. The present report scrutinizes the role of the financial sector in enhancing economic growth in the Lao Peopleâ€™s Democratic Republic and aims to answer the question of adequate financial sector supervision with respect to the economyâ€™s development. It is argued that only a prudentially supervised financial sector can enhance the economic growth performance of the country in the medium and long term.
O49|The Diffusion of Development: Along Genetic or Geographic Lines?| Why are some societies still poor? Recent research suggests that a country's ‘genetic distance’—a measure of the time elapsed since two populations had common ancestry—from the US is a significant predictor of development even after controlling for an ostensibly exhaustive list of geographic, historical, religious and linguistic variables. We find, by contrast, that the correlation of genetic distance from the US and GDP per capita disappears with the addition of controls for geography, including distance from the equator and a dummy for Sub‐Saharan Africa.

O49|Newborn health and the business cycle: Is it good to be born in bad times?|We study the effect of the business cycle on the health of newborn babies using 30 years of birth certificate data for Spain. Exploiting regional variation over time, we find that babies are born healthier when the local unemployment rate is high. Although fertility is lower during recessions, the effect on health is not the result of selection (healthier mothers being more likely to conceive when unemployment is high). We match multiple births to the same parents and find that the main result survives the inclusion of parents fixed-effects. We then explore a range of maternal behaviors as potential channels. Fertility-age women do not appear to engage in significantly healthier behaviors during recessions (in terms of exercise, nutrition, smoking and drinking). However, they are more likely to be out of work. Maternal employment during pregnancy is in turn negatively correlated with babies' health. We conclude that maternal employment is a plausible mediating channel.
O49|Determinantes del crecimiento económico en Bolivia: un enfoque de demanda|La estimación de los determinantes del crecimiento económico es de interés tanto para los tomadores de decisiones como para los analistas. Para este cometido generalmente se estima una función de producción. Sin embargo, en países en desarrollo como Bolivia se enfrentan dificultades en la disponibilidad de información estadística sobre el acervo de capital y cifras sobre empleo. Por esta razón, en línea con la literatura internacional reciente, en este trabajo se optó por la estimación de una especificación econométrica ad hoc de demanda, mediante modelos de corrección de errores y vectores autorregresivos bayesianos (BVAR). El resultado del trabajo señala que la demanda interna es la fuente principal del crecimiento económico en Bolivia, entre cuyos componentes destaca el consumo privado, principalmente de alimentos.
O49|Specific and General Human Capital in an Endogenous Growth Model|In this paper, we define specific (general) human capital in terms of the occupations whose use is spread in a limited (wide) set of industries. We analyze the growth impact of an economy's composition of specific and general human capital, in a model where education and R&D are costly and complementary activities. The model suggests that a declining share of specific human capital, as observed in the Czech Republic, can be associated with a lower rate of long run growth. We also discuss optimal educational policies in the presence of market frictions.

Realiza un recorrido por la literatura referente al crecimiento económico y el capital humano, representado por la salud y la educación, de tal manera que, con las fuentes de información disponibles en Colombia, realiza una selección de datos que permite la obtención de variables que reflejen y cuantifiquen los canales de trasmisión sugeridos por la teoría existente. Para terminar, especifica un modelo empírico que estima la relación teórica entre el capital humano y el crecimiento económico.
O49|Potential output from a euro area perspective|This paper reviews potential output from a euro area perspective by summarising the developments according to international institutions and assessing the impact of the crisis. The paper also considers the methodological basis for potential output estimates, and the high degree of uncertainty that surrounds them. Although it is too early to see the full effects of structural reforms implemented since 2007/08, further structural reforms are needed to support euro area potential growth, especially in view of the negative impact that population ageing is expected to have on potential growth in the future.

O49|Effects of knowledge capital on total factor productivity in China: A spatial econometric perspective|The transformation of China into a knowledge based economy is one of the most intensively debated research issues in Economic Geography. The focus of this study is on effects of knowledge capital on manufacturing total factor productivity (TFP) in China through the lens of the regional knowledge capital model (KCM). The objective is to estimate the impact of region-internal and region-external knowledge capital — measured in terms of patents granted by the Chinese patent office — on TFP across Chinese regions. We derive a Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) for empirical testing, using panel data on 29 Chinese regions for the years 1988–2007. The results indeed point to a shift of Chinese productivity growth to a more knowledge based one, statistically confirming the impact of knowledge capital on regional TFP after 1998. Furthermore, this shift is not only based on region-internal knowledge capital, but also on inter-regional knowledge spillovers.
O49|The Growth-Inflation Nexus for the US over 1801-2013: A Semiparametric Approach|We try and detect whether there exists a threshold level of inflation for the US economy over 1801-2013, beyond which it has a negative effect on economic growth. We use a combination of nonparametric (NP) and instrumental variable semiparametric (SNP-IV) methods to obtain inflation thresholds for the United States. The results suggest that the relationship between growth and inflation is hump shaped—that higher levels of inflation reduce growth more. Our results consistently show that inflation above two per cent negatively affects growth.
O49|Directed technological change, skill complementarities and sectoral productivity growth: evidence from industrialized countries during the new economy|Recent growth accounting exercises attribute strong productivity growth to increased investments in information and communication technologies (ICT) over the last decades, but abstain from potential complementarity effects with other inputs. Based on three different sets of industrialized countries, this study shows that sectoral productivity growth originated from ICT-skill complementarities and skill-biased technological change (SBTC) during the New Economy. In particular, Scandinavian goods-producing sectors and Anglo–Saxon market services reveal strong SBTC effects that originated from ICT-skill complementarities, while such effects were totally missing in Continental market services during the same periods. Further drivers of productivity growth were intermediate and non-ICT capital deepening. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014
O49|Does trade drive global output growth?|Conventional econometric analysis suggests that there has been a longer-term relationship between nominal world output and nominal world exports. The analysis says something about the rules governing adjustments in world output and exports. It appears that GDP plays the first fiddle. Rising world output seems to have pushed up world exports. But rising world exports do not seem to have resulted in positive changes in global GDP. The global growth slowdown, observed since the early 1970s, may have been linked to the steady expansion of global trade.
O49|Structural Change and Per Capita Income in Nepal: Empirical Evidences|This paper empirically examines Nepalese economic structure by applying OLS technique on the annual series of sectoral growth, population and capital related variables ranging from 1975 – 2012. The estimates obtained with due consideration of stationarity of the series including HP filter revealed that industrial sector is significant to increase per capita income compared to the agriculture and service sectors in Nepal. Moreover, health as indicated by life expectancy and population at working age are found to be substantial to increase the income but, education and capital formation are found insignificant. It is inferred that employment matters for raising per capita income, requiring employment-led growth rather mere growth of economic sub-sectors. Hence, it is needed to have balanced contribution of economic sub-sectors and their employment share to national economy along with healthy workforce to raise the per capita income.
O49|Structural Changes in a Small and Open Economy: Evidences from Nepal|This paper reviews existing structural transformation models and prominent literatures and then empirically examines Nepalese economic structure. The research findings reveal that industrial sector is significant to increase per capita income compared to the agriculture and services sectors in Nepal. Moreover, health as indicated by life expectancy and population at workingage are found to be significant to increase the income but, education and capital formation are found inconsistent with the theory and international empirics. Likewise, developing agricultural sector looks prerequisite for high and sustainable growth however efforts should be made in increasing investment significantly for the mechanization and modernization of agriculture. Developing infrastructures and fostering favorable business environment are other pre-requisites to support growth. In addition, employment-led service sector development is must with more emphasis on the tourism and human capital development .

Οι αιτίες αυτού του φαινομένου μπορούν να εντοπιστούν τόσο στα συστατικά της, όσο και σε άλλους παράγοντες οι οποίοι συντέλεσαν στην εικόνα αυτή. Προβαίνοντας σε μια μελέτη άλλων χωρών της Ευρωζώνης, αρχικά εντοπίζουμε κάποιους από τους παράγοντες οι οποίοι συνδέονται με τα επίπεδα της αποταμίευσης και στη συνέχεια με μια συγκριτική ανάλυση με την Ελλάδα, αναδεικνύουμε κάποιες από τις αιτίες της πορείας αυτής. Εστιάζοντας στην Ελλάδα, εντοπίζουμε τα Εισοδήματα από την Αλλοδαπή και το Ισοζύγιο Μεταβιβάσεων, ως παράγοντες βαρύνουσας σημασίας στην πορεία της Εθνικής Αποταμίευσης, κάνοντας τη διάκριση μεταξύ αυτής και της Εγχώριας. Έχοντας στη συνέχεια υπόψη τους εξωτερικούς αυτούς παράγοντες από τη μία και την Εγχώρια Αποταμίευση από την άλλη, επιχειρούμε μία ανάλυση της επίδρασης αυτών των παραγόντων στην Ανάπτυξη. Τα κύρια ευρήματα της μελέτης μας είναι ότι τα επίπεδα της Εθνικής αποταμίευσης στην Ελλάδα μπορούν να αιτιολογηθούν μέσα από ένα υπόδειγμα βασισμένο σε χώρες της Ζώνης του Ευρώ χρησιμοποιώντας ως παραμέτρους τις Εξαγωγές, τον Πληθωρισμό, τη μεταβολή των Δαπανών της Γενικής Κυβέρνησης και την ίδια την Ανάπτυξη. Επιπλέον, με το πέρας των ετών, ενώ η Εθνική Αποταμίευση συγκριτικά με τις υπόλοιπες χώρες είναι σαφώς μεγαλύτερη της Εγχώριας, υπονοώντας την επίδραση των στοιχείων της Εθνικής αποταμίευσης που σχετίζονται με το εξωτερικό, δηλαδή των Εισοδημάτων και των Μεταβιβάσεων, στο τέλος της εικοσαετίας παρατηρείται μία ταύτιση των δύο εξαιτίας της εξάλειψης αυτών των εξωτερικών παραγόντων. Εστιάζοντας στη συνέχεια σε αυτούς τους παράγοντες και συνδέοντας τους με την ανάπτυξη, βρίσκουμε θετικές επιδράσεις σε αυτήν τόσο από την Εγχώρια Αποταμίευση, όσο και από τα Εισοδήματα και τις Μεταβιβάσεις. Τα θετικά παρ' όλα αυτά οφέλη για την ανάπτυξη από μία θετική μεταβολή αυτών των παραγόντων, μπορεί να μην είναι ορατά παρά μόνο από το τρίτο έτος της μεταβολής. Μολονότι οι εξωτερικοί παράγοντες έχουν πλέον σχεδόν εξαλειφθεί, σημαντικό είναι το γεγονός ότι και η Εγχώρια Αποταμίευση από μόνη της μπορεί να ωφελεί την Ανάπτυξη. Τα αποτελέσματα παρ' όλα αυτά, θα πρέπει να ληφθούν υπόψη με επιφύλαξη, κυρίως εξαιτίας του μικρού μεγέθους του δείγματός μας, αλλά και πιθανού σφάλματος των υποθέσεων που κάναμε στην εφαρμογή των υποδειγμάτων.
O49|Nepal-Potential Projects in a New Model of Economy|Rising GDP level is aim of each economy in the world and in that respect Nepal doesn’t differ. Difficulties in obtaining better impulse in the growth creation shows signs of short and long term weaknesses in economic or political process. Some help in achieving better standards are presented by three projects as well as offering some new insight into possible model change. Building a new model or growing from existing one is not a matter of copy/ paste data from country to country, but necessity and recognition that numerous possibilities to improve exist by cooperation with region ,world but at the same time being aware of its own standards, limitations and strengths. This process is area of constant development, error recognition and correction what is also to be recognized and to further develop in a process of finding economic and social path to go.
O49|The economic efficiency of beef cattle in extensive system|In Romania there are large areas of unused pasture, which are well suited for the meat breeds and the geoclimatic conditions are favorable for beef. The beef breeds are more profitable than the milk ones. They have a yield of 65-70% cut, the meat quality is very good and the animals are not at all pretentious for food, they consume all plant debris. One advantage is that the growth rate of animals is faster, a calf, for example, can reach in 15-20 months at a weight of 550-650 kg.

O49|Technology Spillovers and International Borders: A Spatial Econometric Analysis| The borders of the EU are open for the movement of resources but still there can be some strong negative effects of international borders on productivity and knowledge spillovers compared to the internal regional borders. These negative effects could be due to language barriers, cultural differences, local rules and regulation, legal issues, property rights, etc. These effects of international borders have an economic significance that need to be controlled when analyzing the regional knowledge spillovers. This aspect related to international borders has not been fully taken into account in the existing literature related to knowledge spillovers, therefore, ignoring this effect might under- or overestimate the effect of knowledge and technology spillovers. The results show that technology and knowledge spillovers are mainly coming from internal neighbor regions only, whereas spillovers across the international borders are statistically insignificant. Moreover, the results show that not properly incorporating border effects will lead to inaccurate estimates of the spillovers.
O49|Desempeño económico regional: un análisis dinámico para el caso chileno en el período 1960-2009|Entre 1985 y 1998 la tasa de crecimiento de Chile se encontró entre las cuatro primeras del mundo (Massad, 2002; Gallego & Loayza, 2002) siendo, sin embargo, sumamente heterogéneo el comportamiento a nivel territorial. El objetivo de este trabajo es analizar cuán disímiles han sido los desempeños económicos de las regiones chilenas en las últimas cinco décadas (1960- 2009) en relación con las políticas económicas implementadas. Una novedosa metodología de análisis de clusters, basada en el estudio de la dinámica de regímenes, es usada para el estudio de la convergencia y/o divergencia del comportamiento de las distintas regiones.
O49|Convergencia regional en el índice de desarrollo humano en Colombia|Una de las preocupaciones básicas acerca de la teoría del crecimiento y desarrollo económico ha sido la de conocer si las diferencias en los niveles de bienestar y riqueza existentes entre países tienden a disminuir o a desaparecer. Desde un debate amplio sobre la teoría de la convergencia y teniendo en cuenta las definiciones y los objetivos del desarrollo humano, este trabajo, mediante la aplicación de la técnica econométrica de datos de panel, pretende encontrar el grado de convergencia regional en Colombia, abordando la importancia que tienen las disparidades en el contexto del desarrollo humano, el cual surge como herramienta fundamental para el crecimiento económico sostenible y generalizado, que además de generar productividad en la economía, puede contribuir en la disminución de las brechas de inequidad. El enfoque de este informe de investigación estará encaminado por los lineamientos neoclásicos, inmersos en el contexto multidimensional del índice de desarrollo humano (IDH).
O49|Von der Euroeinführung zur Schuldenkrise: Ergebnisse einer Wachstumszerlegung für ausgewählte Länder des Euroraums|In the aftermath of the Great Recession, the Euro Area turned into a deep financial and currency crisis. Depending on their economic structures, however, member countries have been affected in different ways. Performing a growth accounting for Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal, it turns out that large capital investments paved the way for growth in pre-crisis years. While this led to productivity-enhancing structural change in Greece and Portugal, overcapacities were created in the Spanish construction sector. Eliminating these overcapacities led to declining production in post-crisis years albeit to a highly different extent in the considered countries. Despite employment being still on the decline in several countries, structural reforms should be pursued to stop further labor and capital outflow. In Folge der Großen Regression wurde im Euroraum eine Finanz- und Währungskrise ausgelöst, deren unterschiedliche Auswirkungen auch in der Entwicklung der Wirtschaftsstrukturen seit der Euroeinführung begründet sind. In diesem Aufsatz wird ein Growth Accounting für die Volkswirtschaften Deutschland, Frankreich, Italien, Spanien Griechenland und Portugal durchgeführt. Das Wachstum der Jahre 2000-2007 basiert vornehmlich auf kräftigen Kapitalinvestitionen, die in Griechenland und Portugal für einen produktivitätssteigernden strukturellen Wandel genutzt wurden, während vor allem in Spanien Überkapazitäten im Bausektor gebildet wurden. Der Abbau dieser Überkapazitäten führte in den Jahren nach 2008 zu unterschiedlich tiefen Produktionseinbrüchen. Trotz der Einleitung struktureller Reformen verzögert sich der Wiederaufbau der Beschäftigung bislang. Ein Aufrechterhalten des Reformprozesses scheint jedoch geboten, um eine bereits begonnene Abwanderung des Kapitals und des Arbeitskräftepotentials einzudämmen.
O49|Bienestar subjetivo y crecimiento económico: analizando la paradoja del crecimiento infeliz en la Encuesta Mundial Gallup|The “unhappy growth paradox” found by Deaton (2008) and Lora and Chaparro (2008) on the Gallup World Pool (GWP) 2006 is inconsistent with the literature in terms of the impact of income on well-being in the short term. This paper incorporates alternatively inequality indicators and the change in subjective well-being in the cross-country analysis. The first exercise shows that inequality cannot explain the paradox. The second exercise shows that the results in the GWP 2006 return to be consistent with literature in the short term when the correctly specification of the relationship is set.
O49|Economic complexity: Conceptual grounding of a new metrics for global competitiveness|The availability of data corresponding to the products exported by all countries provides an excellent dataset to test economic ideas and extracts new information about the process of economic development. The matrix of countries and exported products shows a marked triangular structure instead of the block-diagonal structure expected from Ricardian arguments of specialization. This observation points to the fact that diversification is instead the dominant effect in the globalized market. We discuss how to define a suitable non-monetary metrics for the value of diversification and the effective complexity of products. We discuss in detail the previous proposed approaches to assess this challenge and their limitations. We introduce a new approach to the definition of these metrics which seems to overcome the previous problems and we test it in a series of model systems.
O49|Cultural impact on national economic growth|Following Fukuyama's (2001) postulation for future research in economic development, this paper examines the cultural hypothesis regarding national economic prosperity. Culture is found to affect economic performance through two channels; cultural traits that stimulate individual motivation, and traits that develop social capital in the population. Culture is defined as a society's beliefs and value system and operationalized through the use of variables from the World Values Survey (WVS). The analysis controls for factors commonly recognized in the economic growth literature. The results are sustained through a sensitivity analysis using a variant of extreme bounds analysis (EBA). Compared with previous empirical studies, this research deepens the cultural analysis, increases the number of observations, and lengthens the time period studied.
O49|Does Openness Increase the Efficiency of China¡¯s Manufacturing Firms? Evidence from the World Bank Investment Climate Survey|Based on the World Bank Investment Climate Survey, this paper investigates the openness effects on the efficiency of firms in China¡¯s manufacturing industry using a two-step data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach. In the first step, the aggregate efficiency of open firms and non-open firms is compared in each sub-industry using a group-wise heterogeneous bootstrap procedure. The results show, at a 90% confidence level, that open firms are more efficient than non-open firms in four out of five sub-industries. Furthermore, in the second step, we employ the two-stage bootstrap DEA approach to more specifically evaluate the effects of openness on the efficiency of firms. The regression results show that three openness indicators (foreign capital, import and export) have strong positive effects on firms¡¯ efficiency in China¡¯s manufacturing industry. In addition, the results also suggest that a larger state share, larger firm size, and more capital stock are negatively related to the efficiencies of firms, while a firms¡¯ learning and absorptive capacity is positively related to its efficiency.

As a result, considerable discrepancies in urbanization process and its infrastructure provision are revealed, and new sources of finance for solution of this problem are offered.
O49|Price Indexes for Clinical Trial Research: A Feasibility Study|"We estimate hedonic price indexes for clinical trial research, an important component of biomedical R&D, using a large sample of agreements between trial sponsors and clinical investigators obtained from Medidata Solutions Worldwide Inc. Nominal prices measured as total grant cost per patient rose by a factor of 4.5 between 1989 and 2011, while the NIH Biomedical R&D Price Index (BRDPI) focused on input costs rose only 2.2-fold. Most of the disparity appears to be attributable to changes in the nature and organization of clinical trials: during this period the average number of patients per site fell substantially while ""site work effort"" more than doubled. After controlling for these changes in the characteristics of investigator agreements using a variety of methods based on hedonic regressions, we find that the estimated rate of inflation in clinical trials costs tracks the BDRPI very closely. Results from this study suggest that it should be feasible for statistical agencies to develop a producer price index for this type of R&D activity, contributing to broader efforts to develop a deflator for contracted R&D services."
O49|Productivity As Registered Transfers Between Economic Entities. A Theoretical Intuitive Approach|This paper aims at courageously building the design of a conceptual system of thinking economics, conceived as an alternative to the routine one. In this purpose, methodologically, the paper is, pointing out several of our main conceptions that are developed in our researches, also several recent set of ideas and most recent works in the economic literature concerning the topic of productivity. Part of a larger research, our approach blame the common practice in economic life and, as well, in economics theoretical analyses concerning the conceiving and assessing productivity, as being almost exclusively quantitative and formal (ignoring important qualitative and causal aspects of the economic complex process). The organization and building of the paper is made in the logic of presenting the key concepts that are the pillars of the presented system of thinking, starting with the recent context of the New Long Crisis, with the requirements of the concept of knowledge society, with references to the European Union approaches, presenting our opinion concerning the value state and meaning, and finding them in the actual economic growth concept, which is presented as responsible for the entering in the New Long Crisis. Several roots from the genuine liberalism are invoked, in the more recent scientific environment of the service economy, which brought important new ideas and understandings concerning the general design of an economic activity (be it material or immaterial), the intellectual core of all human acts, the servicity approach, recovering the genuine conception on value and productivity. The debate results in pointing out several capital common misunderstandings which give occasion to (and even require) alternative approaches and conclusions, approaches which are conceived as (and can be) useful for developments in better directions that are solving problems on the very long time. The occasion is used also for reminding a most recent conception on an alternative economy.

En la primera sección se revisan los antecedentes. Seguidamente, se presentan los principales conceptos metodológicos: régimen, dinámica de regímenes y evolución de clusters. Los estados mejor posicionados de Brasil muestran un proceso de convergencia interregional de dinámica de regímenes con las regiones más ricas de Argentina y Uruguay; mientras que Paraguay, las regiones del norte brasileño y las provincias argentinas históricamente más retrasadas permanecen en estadios de baja performance económica, reduciendo la distancia intragrupo pero evidenciando un proceso de divergencia respecto del grupo de alto desempeño. El resultado arroja evidencias a favor de la convergencia por clubes de desempeño. La discusión final se centra en las consecuencias de la integración económica sobre este proceso. || This paper studies the regional convergence of sub-national states in the case of Mercosur from 1961 to 2005 by using a non-parametric technique of clustering under the concept of \regime of performance"". In the first section, a review in interregional convergence is shown for the Mercosur case. Then, methodological concepts are introduced: regimens, dynamic of regimens, and clusters evolution. The best positioned Brazilian states show an interregional convergence process in dynamics of regimens towards the richest Argentinean regions and Uruguay; moreover, Paraguay, the North part of Brazil and the historically underdevelopment regions of Argentina are in scenarios of low economic performance, reducing the intra-group distance but showing a divergence process in reference to the highest income group. Results exhibit evidences in favor to convergence clubs of performance. The final discussion deals with the consequences of economic integration on that process."

The final objective of such project is to allow entrepreneurs and investors to build in the city new ventures that can create employment, build an entrepreneurship culture, and develop local talent. It also focus on networking as the foundation to gain efficiency and economies of scale that can turn local and small SME´s into a large cooperation that, with the managerial and strategic help of the agency, can produce results in external markets.
O49|Energy and capital inputs: cornerstones of productivity growth in Mexico: 1965–2004|Gross domestic product per remunerated labor (GDP/L), known as the Mexican average productivity, grew very rapidly from 1965 to 1979; it increased at an average annual rate of 3.7%. But from 1979 through 2004, productivity stagnated with an average annual growth rate of only 0.19%. The hypothesis is that from 1965 through 1979, productivity increased rapidly because of concomitant growth in the utilized capital and energy per worker and the improvements in technology. After 1979, the productivity growth came to a standstill because of a slowdown in investment and stagnation in the utilized capital and energy per worker due to the sharply rising energy prices. The tool chosen to test this hypothesis is an aggregate Cobb-Douglas production function characterized by technical change embodied in the gross investment in new machinery and equipment. The estimation of this model shows energy as a cornerstone of productivity growth independent of capital and new technology. Copyright Springer-Verlag 2013
O49|Does Trade Drive Global Growth?|Conventional econometric analysis using VEC suggests that there is a long-term relationship between nominal world GDP and nominal world exports. The analysis cannot say anything about the causal relationships between the levels of GDP and exports. But it says a lot about the rules governing the short-term adjustments in GDP and exports. When considering such short-term adjustments, GDP plays the first fiddle. Short-term GDP changes have driven short-term changes in world exports, at least over the years 1987-2008. But the short-term changes in world exports did not ‘cause’ positive short-term changes in GDP.
O49|Earthquakes and Economic Growth|This study explores the economic consequences of earthquakes. In particular, it is investigated how exposure to earthquakes aects economic growth both across and within countries. The key result of the empirical analysis is that while there are no observable eects at the country level, earthquake exposure signicantly decreases 5-year economic growth at the local level. Areas at lower stages of economic development suer harder in terms of economic growth than richer areas. In addition, the analysis proposes an explanation to the paradox that there is a pronounced negative eect at the regional level while no eect appears at the country level. To this end, the eects of earthquake exposure is investigated not only for the impact zones, but also for areas with an average distance to the epicenter of around 100 km. The results indicate that the decrease in production in one part of a country is (partially) o-set by an increase in production in the surrounding regions.
O49|Cost Push Factors of Bulgarian Inflation|The paper studies the behavior of nominal and real wages, average labor productivity, the exchange rate of Bulgarian lev against the dollar, and the world price of oil. It examines the specific parameters of their change in the periods of high and moderate inflation, and outlines the peculiarities of their effects on price fluctuations. It is concluded that an increase in wages serves as a booster of inflation in both periods because of their faster growth rates compared to an increase in the average labor productivity. The second major conclusion drawn is that the depreciation of Bulgarian lev against the dollar is also a source of both high and moderate inflation, and its role is particularly important in extremely high inflation episodes and relatively limited in the period after mid-1997. On the other hand changes in oil prices are manifested as a factor of inflation mainly in the second period, although their effect is sporadic and comparatively smaller than the respective contribution of rising wages and decreasing exchange rate.
O49|A theory of planning horizons (1): market design in a post-neoclassical world|The neoclassical case supporting competitive frames and market solutions has failed to promote stable world-wide economic development. Other approaches in economics incorporate social culture, increasing returns, market power, ecological limits and complementarity, yielding broader applications for development theory. In this paper a theory of planning horizons is introduced to raise some meaningful questions about the traditional view with respect to its substitution, decreasing returns and independence assumptions. Suppositions of complementarity, increasing returns and interdependence suggest that competition is inefficient by upholding a myopic culture resistant to learning. Growth – though long believed to rise from markets and competitive values – may not derive from these sources. Instead, as civilizations advance, shifting from material wants to higher-order intangible output, they evolve from market tradeoffs (substitution and scarcity) into realms of common need (complementarity and abundance). The policy implications of horizonal theory are explored, with respect to regulatory aims and economic concerns. Such an approach emphasizes strict constraints against entry barriers, ecological harm, market power abuse and ethical lapses. Social cohesion – not competition – is sought as a means to extend horizons and thereby increase efficiency, equity and ecological health. The overriding importance of horizon effects for regulatory assessment dominates other orthodox standards in economics and law. Reframing economics along horizonal lines suggests some meaningful insight on the proper design of economic systems.
O49|A theory of planning horizons (2): the foundation for an ethical economics|The concept of planning horizons serves as a measure of many unsettled aspects of economic analysis. First and foremost, the notion is ordinal: we speak of ‘horizon effects’ as directional shifts in planning horizons without tallying ‘wits’ or calibrating horizonal axes of change. Second, the derivation of horizon effects is inductive; we simply assert their inherence in the range of factors subsumed within the imagined projections behind all choice. The planning horizon is set wherever surprise supplants expectation; the horizon occurs at the outer range of accurate anticipation, to which we lack clear epistemological access. Planning horizons – horizon effects – suggest a new foundation for an ethical economics of conscience, social maturation and growth. The idea of planning horizons invites a distinction of foresight from myopia in economic constructions. But time horizons are only one aspect of our planning horizons: to see ahead in time we must embrace all relevant causal effects. Foresight depends on knowledge of how reality actually works, which is a matter more of degree than ‘truth’; the planning horizon offers an index of our ‘rational bounds.’ Our range of anticipation is also related to our internalization of social and ecological externalities in our decisions, so to the scope of our ethical conscience and to our sense of human community. Indeed, the organizational health and integrity of our society is horizonal in this sense. The aim of this paper is to explore and develop the concept of planning horizons in its intellectual origins and economic concerns. Its philosophic conceptual roots, methodological underpinnings, psychological insights and economic implications are outlined to show why an economics of planning horizons offers an ethical economics of interdependent dynamic complex systems. With standard doctrines seen as a special case in a larger horizonal frame, social theory embraces an ethical economics with dissimilar institutional implications favoring cooperation.
O49|How Deep Are the Roots of Economic Development?|The empirical literature on economic growth and development has moved from the study of proximate determinants to the analysis of ever deeper, more fundamental factors, rooted in long-term history. A growing body of new empirical work focuses on the measurement and estimation of the effects of historical variables on contemporary income by explicitly taking into account the ancestral composition of current populations. The evidence suggests that economic development is affected by traits that have been transmitted across generations over the very long run. This article surveys this new literature and provides a framework to discuss different channels through which intergenerationally transmitted characteristics may impact economic development, biologically (via genetic or epigenetic transmission) and culturally (via behavioral or symbolic transmission). An important issue is whether historically transmitted traits have affected development through their direct impact on productivity, or have operated indirectly as barriers to the diffusion of productivityenhancing innovations across populations.
O49|The persistence of (subnational) fortune : geography, agglomeration, and institutions in the new world|Using subnational historical data, this paper establishes the within country persistence of economic activity in the New World over the last half millennium. The paper constructs a data set incorporating measures of pre-colonial population density, new measures of present regional per capita income and population, and a comprehensive set of locational fundamentals. These fundamentals are shown to have explanatory power: native populations throughout the hemisphere were found in more livable and productive places. It is then shown that high pre-colonial density areas tend to be dense today: population agglomerations persist. The data and historical evidence suggest this is due partly to locational fundamentals, but also to classic agglomeration effects: colonialists established settlements near existing native populations for reasons of labor, trade, knowledge and defense. Further, high density (historically prosperous) areas also tend to have higher incomes today, and largely due to agglomeration effects: fortune persists for the United States and most of Latin America. Finally extractive institutions, in this case, slavery, reduce persistence even if they do not overwhelm other forces in its favor.
O49|Efectos de derrame y de retroalimentación industrial en América del Norte: un enfoque nacional e internacional|The nation’s economic strategy has been the formation of trade blocks under the theory of comparative advantage. However, empirical evidence shows that the multipliers of trade on economic structure not all countries are as predicted by theory. This paper analyzes Feedback and Spillover effects for International Coefficients Matrix in North America constructed with Chenery - Moses model and the UNCTAD data. In the Canadian economy structure the trilateral matrix results suggests that the Feedback and Spillover effects are significant on the demand side whereas in the case of Mexico they are higher in the supply side. In regard to the United States, Feedback and Spillover are significant on the supply and demand side. Also the results conclude that Spillovers from United States to its partners business by exports and imports are lower than those from Canada and Mexico to United States.
O49|Has the Financial Crisis Changed the Business Cycle Characteristics of the GIPSI Countries?| Since the financial crisis erupted in 2008, the governments of Portugal, Ireland, Italy Greece and Spain (GIPSI) find themselves in a position where financing their debts has become increasingly difficult. As a result, these governments reduced government expenditure and/or increased taxes in order to reduce their deficits. Hence, whilst other countries in the Eurozone – notably Germany - enjoy a recovery from the financial crisis, the GIPSI countries remain in recession. It is therefore no surprise that the business cycles of the northern and southern European countries have increasingly diverged. This in itself poses already a risk for the Eurozone, as it makes the common monetary policy less effective. In this paper we analyse these business cycles in detail. We ask whether the financial crisis has changed the characteristics of the business cycles of the GIPSI countries. For example, the austerity measures in Greece may lead to a convergence of government spending between Germany and Greece and to greater convergence of business cycles in both countries. If this is the case, then at least there is some hope that the common monetary policy will be more effective in the future. But the austerity measures could also lead to greater divergence between Greece and Germany, in which case leaving the monetary Union would not only be beneficial for Greece. It might be unavoidable.
O49|Panel Data Evidence on the Role of Education in the Growth-Volatility Relationship|The investigation of the growth-volatility link is an important one in empirical macroeconomics. There is no empirical evidence supporting the predictions of recent theoretical models that incorporate and explicitly recognize the role of human capital in this link. Using a panel data, we show empirically how the detrimental effect of output volatility on growth is diluted by education. We provide robustness checks and policy implications of our finding.
O49|Convergencia interregional en dinámica de regimenes: el caso del Mercosur<BR>[Regional convergence of dynamic of regimens: the case of Mercosur]|This paper analyses the regional convergence of sub-national states in the case of Mercosur from 1961 to 2005 by using a non-parametric techniques of clustering under the concept of regime of performance. That is, the convergence between two regions is established by the approximation of their dynamic of regimens. The best positioned Brazilian states show an interregional convergence process in dynamics of regimens towards the richest Argentinean regions and Uruguay; moreover Paraguay, the north part of Brazil and the historically underdevelopment regions of Argentina are in scenarios of low economic performance, reducing the intra-group distance but showing a divergence process in reference to the highest income group. Results exhibit evidence in favor to convergence clubs of performance.
O49|On feedback nash equilibrium and cooperation in the neoclassical growth model|Far away from any ideological point of view, our aim in this paper is to study, in a differential-game-theoretical approach, the standard growth model. Our baseline model comes from Kaitala y Pohjola (2009) based on the original ideas of Lancaster (1973). We focus on the computation of feedback strategies and we use history-dependent strategies, such as trigger strategies, in which to begin by cooperating and will cooperate as long as the rivals do, and upon observing a defection, it will immediately imply to revert to a period of punishment of specified length in which everyone plays non-cooperatively. We show that trigger strategies are employed by both groups to sustain cooperation as equilibrium. Then, we conclude that players’ memory strategies are the key for attaining the maximum economic growth.
O49|Total-factor energy efficiency in the EU countries|The purpose of this research is to examine the economy-wide energy efficiency changes in the EU countries in the period from 2000 to 2010 and to compare the results with the traditional energy efficiency indicator. The DEA CCR multiple input-oriented model is applied in order to analyse the efficiency of the use of three inputs (capital stock, labour and energy consumption) in producing GDP as the output. In order to obtain the dynamics of data as to avoid the use of only a single year in calculating energy efficiency the extended DEA method - window analysis - is adopted. The empirical results confirm that the traditional one-factor energy efficiency indicator is too simplifying and could be misleading. The findings on total-factor energy efficiency scores reflect the possibility of substitution among factors in a medium run and changes in the composition of energy use. Projection values of inputs on efficiency frontier identify the amounts of relative inefficiency and, in that context, suggest improvements for all inefficient countries. The results reveal that all inefficient countries could improve their efficiency by reducing some of the inputs.
O49|Poverty and Survival| A recent literature highlights the uncertainty concerning whether economic growth has any causal protective effect on health and survival. But equal rates of growth often deliver unequal rates of poverty reduction and absolute deprivation is more clearly relevant. Using state-level panel data for India, we contribute the first estimates of the impact of changes in poverty on infant survival. We identify a significant within-state relationship which persists conditional upon state income, indicating the size of survival gains from redistribution in favour of households below the poverty line. The poverty elasticity declines over time after 1981. It is invariant to controlling for income inequality but diminished upon controlling for education, fertility and state health expenditure, and eliminated once we introduce controls for omitted trends.
O49|The Persistence of (Subnational) Fortune: Geography, Agglomeration, and Institutions in the New World|Using subnational historical data, this paper establishes the within country persistence of economic activity in the New World over the last half millennium. We construct a data set incorporating measures of pre-colonial population density, new measures of present regional per capita income and population, and a comprehensive set of locational fundamentals. These fundamentals are shown to have explanatory power: native populations throughout the hemisphere were found in more livable and productive places. We then show that high pre-colonial density areas tend to be dense today: population agglomerations persist. The data and historical evidence suggest this is due partly to locational fundamentals, but also to classic agglomeration effects: colonialists established settlements near existing native populations for reasons of labor, trade, knowledge and defense. We then show that high density (historically prosperous) areas also tend to have higher incomes today, and largely due to agglomeration effects: fortune persists for the United States and most of Latin America. Further, we show that extractive institutions, in our case, slavery, reduce persistence even if they do not overwhelm other forces in its favor.
O49|Growth, inequality, and poverty reduction in developing countries: Recent global evidence|The study presents comparative global evidence on the transformation of economic growth to poverty reduction in developing countries, with emphasis on the role of income inequality. The focus is on the period since the early-mid-1990s when growth in these countries as a group has been relatively strong, surpassing that of the advanced economies. Both regional and country-specific data are analyzed for the $1.25 and $2.50-level poverty headcount ratios using World Bank Povcalnet data. The study finds that on average income growth has been the major driving force behind both the declines and increases in poverty. The study, however, documents substantial regional and country differences that are masked by this ‘average’ dominant-growth story. While in the majority of countries, growth was the major factor behind falling or increasing poverty, inequality, nevertheless, played the crucial role in poverty behavior in a large number of countries. And, even in those countries where growth has been the main driver of poverty-reduction, further progress could have occurred under relatively favorable income distribution. For more efficient policymaking, therefore, idiosyncratic attributes of countries should be emphasized. In general, high initial levels of inequality limit the effectiveness of growth in reducing poverty while growing inequality increases poverty directly for a given level of growth. It would seem judicious, therefore, to accord special attention to reducing inequality in certain countries where income distribution is especially unfavorable. Unfortunately, the present study also points to the limited effects of growth and inequality-reducing policies in low-income countries.
O49|Economic development and growth in Colombia: An empirical analysis with super-efficiency DEA and panel data models|In this paper, we analyse economic development and growth through traditional measures (gross domestic product and human development index) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in Colombian departments over the period 1993â2007. We use a DEA model to measure and rank economic development and growth from different approaches such as poverty, equality and security. The results show considerable variation in efficiency scores across departments. A second-stage panel data analysis with fixed effects reveals that higher levels of economic activity, quality life, employment and security are associated with a higher efficiency score based on the standards of living, poverty, equality and security. All findings of this analysis should demonstrate that economic development and growth could be achieved most effectively through a decrease in poverty, an increase in equality, a reduction in violence, and improved security. This indicates the need to generate effective policies that guarantee the achievement of these elements in the interest of all members of society.
O49|Una aproximación a la relación entre desempeño macroeconómico colombiano y conflicto armado interno|El objetivo del presente trabajo es mostrar la relación entre desempeño macroeconómico colombiano y conflicto armado interno.

De esta forma, se genera una evidencia para las explicaciones teóricas sobre la relación entre variables económicas y conflicto.
O49|Trans-Pacific Economic Relations and US-China Business Cycles: Convergence within Asia versus US Economic Leadership|This paper tests the hypothesis that the links and leadership/dependency relationships between the People’s Republic of China (PRC), the United States (US), and the other large Asian economies have changed over the past 20 years with the industrialization of the PRC economy. We use time-varying spectral methods to decompose the links between seven advanced Asian economies and the US. We find: (a) the links with the US have been weakening, while those within a bloc based on the PRC have strengthened; (b) that this is not new—it has been happening since the 1980s, but has been partly reversed by the recent surge in trade; (c) that there are two blocs within the Asian economic area: one based on Japan and the Republic of Korea and the other on the PRC and her satellites; (d) that product composition is responsible for this division (and for some movement between the blocs); and (e) that the links between the PRC and the US are rather complex, with the US able to shape the cycles elsewhere through her control of monetary conditions, but the PRC able to control the size of the cycles at home and (to some extent) abroad.

O49|Las tendencias de la pobreza y la desigualdad: una evidencia para los departamentos de Colombia|This study estimates poverty and inequality trends using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and panel data in Colombia during the sample period between 1993 and 2007. In this analysis, we suggest a DEA model to measure and rank poverty, inequality and development trends. The results from the DEA model show variation in the scores across Colombian departments during the sample period. A second-stage panel data analysis with fixed effects reveals that departments with higher population density, unemployment, homicide rates and property concentration have a lower efficiency score, whereas departments with higher health and education coverage and public investments have better results according to DEA and panel data estimations. Findings of this analysis demonstrate that the decrease in poverty and inequality could be achieved through adequate strategies that guarantee development and economic growth with policies concentrated to improve social welfare.
O49|Are the New Member States Converging on the Euro Area?: A Business Cycle Analysis for Economies in Transition|The Optimal Currency Area theory stresses the importance of co-movement of the business cycles of member states in order for the common currency to be successful. Yet, the identification of (European) business cycles has been inconclusive and is complicated by the enlargement to the new member states in 2004 and their transition to market economies. In this paper, we show how to decompose a business cycle into a time-frequency framework in a way that allows us to compare the growth rate spectra and coherences for the Hungarian, Polish, Czech, German and French economies. We find that, since joining the EU, there has been convergence on the euro area economy at short cycle lengths, but little convergence in long cycles. We argue that this shows evidence of nominal convergence, but little real convergence. The standard Maastricht convergence criteria for membership of the euro therefore need to be adapted to test for real convergence.

O49|Movilidad intergeneracional en Colombia|En este trabajo se analiza la movilidad educativa entre generaciones en Colombia desde 1915 hasta 2003. A través de un nuevo índice se mide la movilidad intergeneracional ascendente, entendida como la probabilidad neta de que los hijos superen la educación de sus padres. Para examinar la incidencia de los retornos de la educación sobre las decisiones educativas y, particularmente, sobre la movilidad intergeneracional, fue necesario construir una serie de rentabilidad de la educación que cubriera el mismo período que el indicador de movilidad. El análisis muestra un considerable aumento de la educación entre generaciones y señala una disminución en el ritmo de crecimiento de la movilidad intergeneracional desde mediados de la década de los setenta; esto podría explicarse, entre otros factores, por el descenso en los retornos de la educación. Finalmente, en el documento se sugiere la existencia de imperfecciones en el mercado para el financiamiento de la educación superior.
