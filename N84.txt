N84|"Discrimination, Managers, and Firm Performance: Evidence from ""Aryanizations"" in Nazi Germany"|We study whether antisemitic discrimination in Nazi Germany had economic effects. Specifically, we investigate how the forced removal of Jewish managers affected large German firms. We collect new data from historical sources on the characteristics of senior managers, stock prices, dividends, and returns on assets for firms listed on the Berlin Stock Exchange. After the removal of the Jewish managers, the senior managers at affected firms had fewer university degrees, less experience, and fewer connections to other firms. The loss of Jewish managers significantly and persistently reduced the stock prices of affected firms for at least 10 years after the Nazis came to power. We find particularly strong reductions for firms where the removal of the Jewish managers led to large decreases in managerial connections to other firms and in the number of university-educated managers. Dividend payments and returns on assets also declined. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the aggregate market valuation of firms listed in Berlin fell by 1.78 percent of German GNP. These findings imply that discrimination can lead to significant economic losses and that individual managers can be key to the success of firms.
N84|Deuss’ demise: an oil trader’s struggle to keep up with the market, 1970s-1990s|In contrast to many other commodities, crude oil trading is a relatively new phenomenon. The end of the concession system in the 1970s caused the oil value chain to disintegrate and a spot market for crude oil to emerge. Oil traders, in particularly the infamous US oil trader Marc Rich, have been credited with creating this spot market and its subsequent development into the global locus of oil price formation. As such traders can be viewed as the little known but vital agents of globalization. Although traders certainly did contribute in the first formative years of the spot market in the late 1970s and early 1980s, their business models were fundamentally challenged by the subsequent evolution of the market in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Whereas globalization is about market integration, traders were typically geared toward profiting from large market distortions and opaque prices. As the spot market matured and gained global acceptance for price formation, the original oil traders were either forced out of the market or fundamentally transformed their businesses. One particular example is Dutch oil trader John Deuss. During the 1980s among the top 3 global oil traders, Deuss’ company languished in the 1990s after a failed corner of the Brent market and competition from firms that were both more sophisticated and better financed. Using Deuss as an example, this paper raises two questions: On the one hand, how did independent oil trading firms contribute to the formation of the modern oil market since the 1970s? On the other hand, how did the subsequent evolution of the market affect the business model of independent oil trading firms from the mid-1980s onwards? The core aim of the paper is to question the relationship between the economics of the trading firm and the economics of the market. The paper combines quantitative data on the development of the spot market using a deals database compiled by Argus Media since 1975 with secondary material ranging from scholarly, trade and news publications.
N84|Women Entrepreneurs in Italy: A Prosopographic Study|Women entrepreneurs have long been an understudied topic in business history. This paper contributes to fill this gap by analyzing Italian women’s entrepreneurship from the mid-20th century to 2016. It is based on a new dataset concerning the profiles of the 80 women who were successful entrepreneurs and became Cavalieri del Lavoro (Knights of Labour), i.e., they were decorated with the Ordine al “Merito del Lavoro” (Order of Merit for Labour), the highest recognition for achievements in the world of business in Italy. The dataset also includes a comparable balanced sample of men who obtained the same award to single out the main similarities and differences between men and women entrepreneurs. This paper employs a quantitative prosopographic approach: after presenting some descriptive statistics and some exemplary cases of women entrepreneurs, it uses cluster analysis to identify typological groups of women versus men entrepreneurs. This paper show that the institutional context and gender stereotypes slowed down the development of Italian women’s entrepreneurial abilities. Women entrepreneurs tend to cluster in family firms and to have become entrepreneurs by inheritance, whereas they have been handicapped in all other fields relevant to entrepreneurial success: access to education (especially STEM), managerial career and experience abroad. Nonetheless, women entrepreneurs operated beyond women’s niches tied to the traditional ideology of femininity, e.g., textiles, garment and services. Several women operated in sectors such as chemicals and engineering in which many Italian industrial districts are specialized.
N84|Share trading activity and the rise of the rentier in the UK before 1920|Using a hand-collected dataset, we examine share trading activity over the period 1882 to 1920 for the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company, one of the largest UK companies of the time. Our main finding is that the steady flow of rentiers into the shareholding constituency of this company stymied share trading activity. Another important finding is that share trading still occurred during the closure of the Stock Exchange in 1914, but on a much-reduced scale. We also find that there was a substantial boom in share trading and in insurance stock prices after World War I.
N84|Cooperative Wineries and Wine Marketing in Spain|Cooperative wineries emerged with a double objective: on the one hand, the common production ofwine, to reduce production costs and at the same time to increase the quality of the product; on the other hand, the common sale of wine, with a reduction of intermediaries and an improvement of the position of winegrowers in the marketing process. Both objectives had to lead to a higher remuneration for the product and, consequently, for producers’ income. In the wine sector producers were mainly small family farmers who faced a context of tendential fall in wine prices and, consequently, a decrease in their income. If the advantages of winemaking in common seem obvious, success in the second objective seems more doubtful. In this article we want to analyze the marketing of wine in Spain through the cooperative wineries: What was their role in the wine trade? What types of sales did they adopt and why? How did they adapt to changes in the wine consumption patterns?
N84|Las sociedades con valores pignorables por el Banco de España y la Gran Depresión|This article examines the physiognomy of the large non-financial Spanish companies during the crisis of 1929 using an original source, consisting of a compilation of accounting material from companies that had their values pledged by the Bank of Spain. The international literature teaches us that the crisis underpinned the flourishing of great companies; while the weakest ones disappeared, the modern companies survived. The large Spanish companies resembled and behaved similarly to European companies during the Depression. However, a duality may be observed in Spain between stable companies and other larger but more fragile ones. The obsolescence of some sectors, the volatility of international demand, the discretionary behaviour of public demand, and its own organisational performance, explain most of these differences.

N84|¿Dinero o trascendencia? La frivolidad del arte durante el Rococó|Background. During the 18th century, a distinctive art style emerged, the Rococo, expression of frivolity and connoisseur taste, where little advances were made in the visual realm. The main objective of this paper is to present a theoretical model that relates royal patronage with artist’s creativity. Methods. This paper presents a theoretical model on the interaction between artists and gallerists of the 18th century, and it allows to study the optimal level of creativity applied by artists to their works. Results. The model predicts a positive relationship between royal patronage and creativity. Conclusions. The death of King Louis XIV and the consequent reduction in royal patronage could explain the decline, documented by art historians, in the level of complexity of art works produced during the Rococo period.// Antecedentes. Durante el siglo XVIII surgió un estilo distintivo de arte, el Rococó, expresión de frivolidad y juicio “conocedor”, donde hubo pocos avances en materia visual. El principal objetivo de este trabajo es establecer un modelo teórico que relacione la caída en el mecenazgo real para las artes con una disminución en la creatividad impregnada a las obras. Métodos. Se presenta un modelo teórico sobre la interacción entre artistas plásticos y galeristas del siglo XVIII, el cual permite estudiar el nivel de creatividad óptimo que los artistas impregnaban a sus obras de arte. Resultado. El modelo predice una relación positiva entre patronazgo real y nivel de creatividad. Conclusiones. La muerte del Rey Luis XIV y la consecuente reducción en el mecenazgo real podrían explicar la caída, documentada por los historiadores del arte, en el nivel de complejidad de las obras producidas durante el periodo Rococó.
N84|For Patriotism and Profit: Advertising in Service of the Swedish Government 1935-1985|Beginning just before the outbreak of World War II, the advertising industry in (neutral) Sweden began cooperating with the government. This cooperation was highly beneficial for the industry during the war as blockades and rationing caused the civilian advertising market to almost disappear. After the war, the cooperation continued, albeit in relation to primarily military matters. Later, however, the government began procuring advertising and media services on largely commercial grounds. Using documents (including previously classified records) from government agencies, trade organizations and individual advertising companies, this study presents the history of the special relationship between private advertising companies and the Swedish government. In the half century after the first examples of government advertising during World War II, distinct phases can be identified. The first phase began with the end of World War II, when government advertising was considered inappropriate during peacetime and cooperation occurred almost exclusively within the National Information Service (an organization similar to the US War Advertising Council), which prepared wartime advertising for World War III. The second phase began in the late 1960s, when the Swedish government began running large public advertising campaigns. The first campaign was connected with the introduction of right-hand traffic in 1967, and later campaigns were aimed at, for example, energy savings and public health. Finally, the third phase began in the late 1970s, when advertising developed into an integral part of public sector activities and government agencies and municipalities became major buyers of media and advertising services. In addition to the history of the relationship between the industry and the government, this paper provides an analysis of the incentives for cooperation and the influence of the public advertising market on the industry structure.
N84|Videotex in Sweden 1977-1993|A monopolist may be more restricted than a company subject to competition and also be less profitable – e.g. due to demands that it provide certain services at a loss. In this paper the Swedish Telecom monopoly, Televerket’s, Videotex projects are used to analyze this phenomenon. From the late 1970: and until the early 1990s, telecom operators across the world developed and deployed Videotex-systems; new public information services usually based on dumb terminals, of which the most well-known was the French Minitel. The systems were at the time of deployment regarded as the technology of the future but they almost universally failed commercially. In this paper, using a case study based on extensive archival sources from the Swedish Telecom monopoly Televerket, and using novel digital research methods, the origins and the introduction of Videotex systems are analyzed. It is also argued that the systems initially made sense in the context of contemporary computer development and market organization, but also that most of them would rapidly have been discontinued had it not been for the monopolist logic of telecom operators. Finally, I introduce the concept of the monopolist’s curse, to explain why this was the case.
N84|Party in Business: The Swedish Social Democratic Party's Advertising Venture 1947-1997|The Social Democratic Party not only ruled Sweden for most of the 20th century; they also owed of one of the country’s largest advertising groups. The company, founded as “Folkreklam” in 1947, later renamed “Förenade ARE-Bolagen” rapidly became the dominant player in outdoor advertising in Sweden, and remained in this position until the late 1980s. This paper covers the history of the company from its inception in the late 1940s to its eventual merger with J C Decaux in the 1990s. Aspects such as governance, strategy and creative development are covered in the paper, and also the importance of the men who ran the company. A central question also covered is why the company lost its leading standing and the Party found it necessary to divest itself of the company. As will be demonstrated the relationship with the ruling Social Democratic party was very beneficial for the company; both when it came to the acquisition of advertising space on billboards and in the public mass transit systems, and for acquisition of customers. During most of the company's active years there were no public tender laws regulating public procurement and Förenade ARE-Bolagen was able to win a number of profitable accounts from government agencies, regions and municipalities without formal competition.
N84|Political Economy, Firm Survival and Entrepreneurship in Turkey: The Case of the Wealth Tax (1942)|In 1942, the Republic of Turkey promulgated a controversial tax on personal wealth to finance mobilization of the army and curb inflation. The extraordinary tax was arbitrarily assessed and the burden fell disproportionately on non-Muslim minorities. The precise transformative effect of the tax on Turkey’s commercial life is not well understood. This article assembles a new dataset of firms operating in Istanbul to show the tax led to a dramatic rise on the liquidation of enterprises with non-Muslim ownership but no effect on Muslims. At the same time, the tax caused a sharp decline in the formation of new non-Muslim firms and a commensurate increase in the number of Muslim firms. The results show that the Wealth Tax forced the dissolution of otherwise productive, older firms and contributed to the further nationalization of the economy.
N84|Banking on a Religious Divide: Accounting for the Success of the Netherlands' Raiffeisen Cooperatives in the Crisis of the 1920s|This article investigates the impact of the socioreligious segregation of Dutch society on the asset allocation choices of rural bankers and the withdrawal behavior of their depositors during the early 1920s. Results suggest that cooperatively-owned Raiffeisen banks for both Catholic and Protestant minority groups could limit their exposure to a debt-deflation crisis, despite operating more precarious balance sheets than banks for majorities. Business histories demonstrate how strict membership criteria and personal guarantors acted as screening and monitoring devices. Banks serving minorities functioned as club goods, managing their exposure to the crisis by exploiting the confessionalized nature of Dutch society.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

Historical analysis reveals that the mechanisms of creating and spreading fashion have not remained constant, but have varied according to social structures, forms of producing and distributing apparel and social media, while the level of influence of fashion on society has increased in line with economic development. This special issue of Investigaciones de Historia Económica-Economic History Research is dedicated to fashion as an economic phenomenon in the contemporary period.

The history of the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne during the interwar period|In the creative industries, managing creativity and business is a complex process. This article explores the history of the oldest and most prestigious employers’ syndicate in the fashion industry, the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture parisienne (1868) during the interwar period, a time of crisis and change. The study of the private, unpublished archives of the syndicate allows us to understand the tensions between management and creativity. Paris fashion entrepreneurs federated to face external and internal challenges. Two major topics emerge from their concerns: the relations of entrepreneurs with the workforce, and the protection of intellectual property rights. The Chambre Syndicale's members, in response, developed social services, schools for apprentices, lobbied the French institutions, and shared information among themselves. In so doing, the Chambre developed unmatched politics of exclusivity that underline the role of the syndicate as a gatekeeper. KEY Classification-JEL: N84
N84|Creativity and innovation of the Italian fashion system in the inter-war period (1919-1943)|The aim of this research is to demonstrate how the Italian fashion system began to take form in the inter-war period. The focus of the research is centred on technical and stylistic innovations implemented especially during the fascist period. The most important innovations were recorded in the field of footwear, female accessories and men's tailoring. The latter became a ground for experimentation with tailoring that led, in the long run, to the emancipation of Italian men's fashion from the secular dependency on the British. Part of the research has been dedicated to the man-made fibre industry set up in the early Twenties, thanks to which Italy managed to become more independent and needed to import fewer raw materials for the textile industry. The research was carried out by making a systematic examination of fashion magazines, and particularly male fashion magazines, until now rarely used for the study of Italian fashion.

N84|"Foreign concessions in the Soviet Union of the 1920s: ""Why split up""?"|Foreign concessions in the USSR existed for a very short period of 8—9 years. The paper considers some causes behind the closure of the concession companies that happened despite the assurances of the Soviet authorities allegedly desiring to attract foreign investment and technology. One of these causes — conflicts between the concessions’ administrations and trade unions in the enterprises; the other refers to the intentionally limited access to financial resources.
N84|Soft budget constraints and regional industrial policy: reinterpreting the rise and fall of DeLorean|The rise and fall of DeLorean Motor Cars Limited has traditionally been interpreted as either the result either of John DeLorean’s psychological flaws or as confirming the supposed limitations of activist industrial policy. However when the episode is examined in greater historical detail, neither of these interpretations is compelling. The reinterpretation outlined here draws on institutional analysis as well as a range of archival sources, much of it previously unreleased. The inefficiencies within the original contractual agreement are highlighted. The lack of credibility associated with this agreement was in turn traceable to the institutional environment (with its associated risk–reward implications) under which industrial policy operated. This environment had a political element: it had been distorted by the Troubles and the resulting fears policymakers had of a cumulative causation relationship between violence and unemployment. Officials in Belfast, against Treasury opposition, advocated state-led entrepreneurship as a policy response.
N84|State intervention and economic growth in Southern Italy: the rise and fall of the ‘Cassa per il Mezzogiorno’ (1950–1986)| In the second half of the twentieth century, the Italian government carried out a massive regional policy in southern Italy, through the State-owned agency ‘Cassa per il Mezzogiorno’ (1950–1986). The article reconstructs the activities of this agency, making use of its yearly reports and of national and local archives. The Cassa was effective in the first two decades, thanks to substantial technical autonomy and, in the 1960s, to a strong focus on industrial development; however, from the 1970s it progressively became an instrument of waste and misallocation. At the local level, we find significant differences between the southern regions, and correspondence between the quality of state intervention and the regional patterns of GDP and productivity.
N84|A “Statute of the Firm” as an antitrust law during the Seventies. Guido Carli’s chairmanship of the Italian Industrial Association (Confindustria)|This paper aims to highlight a newsworthy initiative built up by the Italian Industrial Association which tried to give the Italian economy a forerunner “competition law”; however, in the Seventies Italy proved incapable of tying itself with rules of conduct, which were substituted, empowering an “external constraint”. We will firstly provide an economic and historical-institutional framework of that period; we will then describe the making and the contents of the “Statute of the Firm”, together with a critical analysis on it; finally, we will report some critics around the debate on this proposal, and why the Statute was rejected by entrepreneurs themselves.
N84|«A un panal de rica miel?»: empresas y empresarios en la exportación de aceite de oliva andaluz, 1886-1936|This article examines, from an entrepreneurial perspective, Andalusian olive oil exports in the first third of the twentieth century, when the region became the world’s largest producer. Although the region exhibited good conditions for olive production, the sale of olive oil abroad required certain technological and organizational innovations. With their superior knowledge and experience in national and international markets, foreign or non-Andalusian companies drove this transformation process. Prior to the First World War, these non-local commercial firms were able to integrate the final phase of olive oil production, mainly refining, but rarely entered into the initial phases such as olive cultivation, nor did these companies establish significant connections with the regional companies. The sources of this historical analysis derive from documentation produced by the Spanish Federation of the Olive Oil Industry and by the Mercantile Registers of Andalusia.
N84|What Makes a Successful Entrepreneur? Historical Evidence from Italy (XIX-XX Centuries)|in this paper we employ a “quantitative” prosopographical approach to study the nature and the determinants of entrepreneurial success. Our main source is the “Biographical Dictionary of Italian Entrepreneurs” which contains very detailed information on 608 major Italian entrepreneurs active over more than two centuries. Our findings indicate the multidimensional nature of entrepreneurial success, comprising both a strictly economic and a “celebrity” dimension. Concerning the determinants of success, our findings point to the “political” nature of Italian capitalism.

Facetas de la instrumentación recíproca (1951-1973)|Relationships between the Rif Mines Spanish Company and Francoist State during the independence of Morocco are a good testing ground to analyze the usefulness of the concept of mutual reciprocity agreements, overcoming the notion of State capture. The article is based on archive sources in order to explore the influence of private interests in policy decisions under Franco. It concludes that such influence occurred, but not in an absolute manner, and that political power was not subordinated to private interests, while these interests did not accept the political decisions that were contrary to them without resistance. In short, there were mutual reciprocity, negotiation and tension on both sides, and business interests cannot, in any way, be defined as ‘powerless privileged’. KEY Classification-JEL: N47. N57. N84.

N84|Keynes, Trouton and the Hector Whaling Company. A personal and professional relationship|John Maynard Keynes’ activities on the stock market are well known. One company in which he bought stocks was the Hector Whaling Company Ltd., London – a comparatively small and little known company founded in 1928. The director of this company was Rupert Trouton. He had worked with Keynes for the Government during the First World War, was his student at Cambridge, and became a close partner in the City from the 1920s and onwards. The reason why Keynes invested in Hector was obviously his association with Rupert Trouton. The first part of this paper explores briefly the development of the Hector Whaling Company and its origins in Norway. The main part analyses the relationship between Trouton and Keynes. The focus is on their co-operation relating to Hector Whaling, but their relationship regarding various other businesses, as well as on the personal level, is also described. The paper is based on studies of the Keynes archives in Cambridge as well as newly available archives of the Hector company. The analysis provides new insights to the more general question on the motivations and decisions behind Keynes’ stock market investments as well as the internationalization of the whaling industry in the 1920s and 30s.
N84|Longevity’s factors in small-scale business system: An Italian case study during the 20th century|Firms’ survival and longevity have recently emerged as a new intriguing theme of business history, spreading from the initial studies on family business to all forms of business. In family business the transition to the next generation can represent a strong limit to survival, as it depends on three different longevity factors: the family members’ involvement and commitment, the preparation of an adequate succession planning and the presence of a competitive advantage. Temporal continuity has become an independent topic involving all types of business, with respect to size, ownership and sectorial diversity. The goal of the analysis was to identify the determinants of longevity. The present research moves along this second line of investigation, focusing on small-scale businesses and taking into consideration a case study. The small and medium-scale (SME) system examined is that of Sesto San Giovanni, one of the most important Italian Company-town during the 20th century, considered the ‘industrial district’ of Milan. The study first verifies the evolution of the local SMEs system, highlighting its development during the century. Having defined the context, the attention shifts to the temporal survival of local businesses and its determinants. Finally, the research includes the history of several enterprise experiences to illustrate the analysis’ results.
N84|Fraud and Financial Scandals: A Historical Analysis of Opportunity and Impediment|The paper presents a conceptual framework of financial fraud based on the historical interaction of opportunity and impediment. In the long run the character of opportunity is determined by the technical characteristics of assets and their unique, unknowable or unverifiable features. Impediment is promoted by consensus about the real value of assets, such that through active governance processes, fraudulent deviations from real value can be easily monitored. Active governance requires individuals in positions of responsibility to exercise a duty of care beyond merely being honest themselves. Taking a long run historical perspective and reviewing a selection of British financial frauds and scandals, from the South Sea Bubble to the Global Financial Crisis, the paper notes the periodic occurrence of waves of opportunity and the evolutionary response of passive governance mechanisms.
N84|Historical Aspects, Traditions and Statistical Gaps. The German Economy versus the Romanian Economy|This paper reveals some historical aspects and some common traditions of German and Romanian economies, justifying some of the trends of contemporary decades underlying the statistical gap. The specific method used in this article is a statistical confrontation based on historical variables and statistical data, graphs emphasizing the abnormalities in evolution, etc. After a brief introduction, inside the major part of the structure of this paper some selected economic and social evolutions are presented together for both German and Romanian economies, somehow becoming the limits of the European Union construction. Few general gaps of the two economic marginal models as performance and cohesion are detailed during the historical and statistical investigation and the conclusions anticipates some expectations in the medium term dynamics of these economies. At the same time the article discusses Berlin’s position within EU and argues that Germany remains a selective continental hegemon, bent on securing national primacy and profit more than generating win-win solutions for its neighbours.
N84|IPR-beachheads. Babcock & Wilcox's business and innovation strategies in Spain|During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, American corporations began their multinational expansion to Europe through direct investments in the most-developed economies. Being increasingly aware of scientific and technological knowledge business value, they also began to develop early IPR international protection strategies in order to defend their intangible assets abroad. Before World War II, many of these multinationals had also reached lagging peripheral countries, resulting in a complex European network of subsidiaries and affiliates that has been scarcely studied. This paper delves into the Babcock & Wilcox entrepreneurial conglomerate – one of the most interesting case studies of early multinational expansion – to analyze how it arrived and developed in Spain, what its business and innovation strategies in that market were, and the role of patent management in that process. Our findings reveal that corporate interests in patent capture, control, and administration not only shifted research and innovation handling within firms but also led to quick learning on how to successfully use IPRs as business, legal, and organizational tools for international expansion.
N84|The British commercial houses in Peru and Chile between the two world wars: success and failure|The previously successful British merchant houses on the west coast of South America faced significant problems between the two world wars. Earlier historians have referred to difficulties such as the volatility of commodity prices, the organisation and structure of the firms, and changes in patterns of trade. This paper, instead, compares their different experiences on the basis of archives from the merchants and their banks, concluding that their response to crisis differed, depending on the manner and extent of diversification, their core expertise, the quality of their management, and the support of their banks. The outcomes varied from outright failure to continued growth, with the two largest firms struggling to survive and adapt to the new business environment.

It shows that the free movement of currency, the protection of infant industry, and geographical concentration lie at the foundation of the cluster’s competitive advantage. Drawing on a new set of data, the paper also provides for the first time an estimate of the total deposits held by Andorra’s banks between 1931 and 2007. Based on this new information, the paper reaches the conclusion that the development of the cluster went through four distinct phases in which large companies, acting as leaders, played an important role in enhancing the cluster’s business capabilities.

N84|Opening the black box of entrepreneurship: The Italian case in a historical perspective| The main objective of this paper is to shed light on the Italian entrepreneurship between the beginning of the second industrial revolution and the end of the twentieth century. It is based on a new dataset concerning the profiles of 386 entrepreneurs. The results are twofold: first, by proposing an empirically based taxonomy of Italian entrepreneurs not exclusively founded on intuitions and qualitative judgements, the article provide valuable interpretative elements; second, the article puts forward some hypotheses about the relationship between entrepreneurship and Italian economic growth. In particular a cluster analysis singles out five different entrepreneurial typologies characterised by a widespread tendency to search for new markets, yet a scarce attitude towards innovation. Further it is suggested that the evolution of the institutional context slowed down the development of the entrepreneurial abilities and virtues necessary to grow.
N84|Interlocking directorates and conflicts of interest: the Rotterdamsche Bankvereeniging, Müller & Co. and the Dutch financial crisis of the 1920s| How can interlocking directorates cause financial instability for universal banks? A detailed history of the Rotterdamsche Bankvereeninging in the 1920s answers this question in a case study. This large commercial bank adopted a new German-style universal banking business model from the early 1910s, sharing directors with the firms it financed as a means of controlling its interests. Then, in 1924, it required assistance from the Dutch state in order to survive a bank run brought on by public concerns over its close ties with Müller & Co., a trading conglomerate that suffered badly in the economic downturn of the early 1920s. Using a new narrative history combined with an interpretive model, this article shows how the interlocking directorates between the bank and this major client, and in particular the direction of influence of these interlocks, resulted in a conflict of interest that could not be easily overcome.

Se plantean 2 objetivos: por un lado, analizar el papel desempeñado por la tecnología con relación al cambio organizativo y a los productos y servicios ofertados por las cajas; por otro, investigar la influencia recíproca entre la tecnología y su uso en la banca minorista. Las cajas constituyen un excelente caso de estudio debido a que incorporaron intensivamente tecnología, especialmente a partir de los años 60. La mecanización de las operaciones, la informatización de la gestión y el establecimiento de redes de transferencia de datos tuvieron un excepcional desarrollo. Fue la industria bancaria, antes que otros sectores, quien estimuló la demanda de algunas tecnologías informáticas, lo que constituye un factor idiosincrásico respecto a otros países.

N84|German and British balance of payments with the European neutrals in the Second World War|"""This paper examines the Swedish ball bearings industry during the Second World War, including subsidiary operations in Germany and the United Kingdom.1 It determines that these ball bearings were very important to the war effort in both countries, comprising in total about 58% of German supplies and 31% of British. Despite favouring Germany with more exports, the Swedish government allowed the British access to Swedish territory to ensure the delivery of the bearings through the German blockade. In relation to price increases for other exports, prices for ball bearings were time‐dependent on the position of the acquiring country. From an overall perspective, the United Kingdom received a discount which Germany did not share. However, with the exception of direct exports, representing respectively about 10% and 15% of total German and British supplies, it would have been difficult for the Swedish industry to withhold all supplies of ball bearings to either belligerent."""
N84|En värdefull berättelse Wallenbergarnas historieprojekt|This working paper is about how a series of business history projects was launched in the second half of the twentieth century. In connection with the 1956 centenary of the Wallenberg’s bank, the family assembled the necessary expertise to document the first hundred years. In the 1960s the radical left was highly critical of the Wallenberg’s financial and industrial dynasty; the head of the family, Marcus Wallenberg, accordingly initiated an extensive programme of historical research to show what his family and its enterprises had actually done for Sweden’s economic development. The historian and archivist Gert Nylander was entrusted with the task of recruiting scholars for the various projects: biographies of the family’s successive heads and histories of the major companies in which the Wallenbergs had a controlling interest. The two dozen or so business histories are presented in this article along with their authors, of whom I am one. Marcus Wallenberg’s and Nylander’s mutual trust meant that besides being based on excellent access to the sources, these business histories could meet the standards that professional historians expect. Private industrialists’ interest in their own history is liable to clash with the aims of academic research. In my opinion, in this particular case and thanks to a number of circumstances, fruitful collaboration was achieved to the benefit of historical research into Swedish business.
N84|Structural Change in Distribution Markets in Peripheral Europe: Spanish Food Retailing, 1950-2007|The processes of structural change and modernisation in the food distribution industry have been submitted to different economic and institutional frameworks in European countries. Two essential factors have affected these changes: on one hand, the role of technical, financial and organisational innovations and on the other, institutional factors. The weight of both has varied depending on the historical circumstances of the countries in consideration and their level of development. This paper discusses with the framework of the “latecomers”. In these countries, the factor of innovation has been produced in terms of appropriation, whether this is technological or organisational, usually influenced by foreign models or through direct foreign investment. The impact of these innovations has been highly conditioned by inflexible institutional surroundings. Considering the Spanish food trade in the last sixty years is a good way of dealing with the processes of structural change in Mediterranean Europe. This paper helps one understand the role taken by countries which introduced factors of innovation and growth in less favourable surroundings than those of developed Europe.
N84|Foreign family business and capital flight. The case for a fraud to fail|The research here proposed is a micro-analysis of a business ending in bankruptcy in the aftermaths of the first oil shock, concerning the Italian subsidiary of a German wareenamelling group established in the town of Bassano in 1925. Following the budget reports and the interviews with the former entrepreurs, the company flourished until the 1960s, when managerial and entrepreneurial successions emphasized the growing difficulties deriving from growing labour costs. A tentative reorganization of the company was hindered in 1968 by union resistance and political pressures for the preservation of employment levels. In 1975 the board of directors decided to declare bankruptcy as a consequence of the huge budget losses. However, a subsequent inquiry of the Italian tax authority discovered an accounting fraud concerning hidden profits in 1974 and 1975. The fraud disclosure shows how historical conditions could create the convenience for performance understatement not only for fiscal purposes, but also in order to make divestment possible. However, it is also used here as an element to argue that business sources and the story they tell should not be taken at their face value, and that a different reconstruction of the company's path to failure is possible. The literature concerning the missed recognition of opportunities is then mobilised in order to interpret the inconsistencies that emerge from the triangulation of business archives, press columns and interviews with union representatives and politicians. This allows to put back into perspective what results as an obsession of company management with labour costs, concealing the importance of other competitive elements, such as the increasing specialisation of the producers of home appliances. This 'refractive error' may be typical of businesses operating in (presumed) mature industries at international level, where wage differentials offer the opportunity to pursue quite literally exploitation much further.
N84|Impact of broadband speed on household income: Comparing OECD and BIC|This paper aims to measure the impact of broadband speed access and upgrades on the household income based on a survey comprising 20,000 respondents in eight OECD and three BRIC countries in 2010 (Brazil, India and China). The study is novel, as most previous studies on broadband emphasize the penetration rate as the variable of interest. Moreover, by digging deeper on broadband speed (rather than broadband penetration rate), the problem concerning broadband definition that varies between countries can also be avoided. To investigate the impacts, a treatment effect model is employed using the Propensity Score Matching (PSM). Two aspects are being investigated: the impact of broadband access and the impact of varying broadband speeds on income. For access impact analysis, the samples are one with broadband access at a particular speed level against the other without the broadband access. Moreover, for the speed upgrades, the comparisons are carried out at various speed levels, e.g. users with 2 Mbps compared with the ones with 512 kbps. The results reveal that obtaining access to 0.5 Mbps in the OECD countries would not be expected to yield an increased income. The study suggests a minimum speed requirement where the households are expected to benefit from broadband lies somewhere between 2 Mbps and 4 Mbps. For BIC countries, however, the impact is already visible at 0.5 Mbps. At this speed, broadband users have a greater likelihood to gain 800 USD compared with the unconnected ones which is equivalent to 70 USD per month per household. For speed upgrades, the speed level giving the highest benefit to income in BIC and OECD countries is the same (4 to 8 Mbps), even though higher speed levels (8 to 24 Mbps) seems to contribute more in OECD than BIC countries. Note that the survey was carried out in 2010 when the sample average speed level in OECD countries was only about 4-5 Mbps and 2 Mbps in BIC countries. The analysis is supported by a reasonably strong statistical significance in OECD but not for the BIC countries due to sample limitation.
N84|The financing history of urban water infrastructure in Paris (1807-1925): lessons from the past to enlighten present and future challenges?|Sustainable financing is a major challenge for the water sector both in many developing countries where water and sanitation services are still in the expansion phase and in Europe where the water industry is faced to major investments needs too. To give more depth to the present policy debate a historical perspective on water services financing is needed. This paper is focused on the financing history of the Paris water infrastructure brought to completion in the 1807-1925 time frame (Ourcq canal, water supply network and sewers, long distance aqueducts, water treatment plants, waste water treatment units). A variety of financing schemes and institutional solutions (municipal budget - fiscal resources, concession, municipal bond and land added value capture schemes) are identified and described. A deeper analysis is made on the financial flows of Paris’ water, sanitation and canals service over the 1893-1930 time frame. A discussion on the institutional choices and on the long run cost allocation of the chosen financing schemes is made. It appears that long term debt, inflation and land added value capture mechanisms played key roles in absorbing part of the investments’ costs.
N84|Las cajas de ahorro y el cambio tecnológico antes de Internet, 1945-1995<BR>[Technological change in Spanish Savings Banks before Internet, 1945-1995]|Technical advances in retail banking have had profound repercussions for the competitiveness of individual firms and for the sector as a whole. This paper looks at the role played by new technological resources within the context of organizational change and the products and services offered by Spanish savings banks. These entities constitute an excellent case study, given that they have been incorporating technology intensively, particularly since the 1960’s. In the case in question, persistence had little influence on the process of technological change. However, the mechanization of operations, the computerization of administrative systems and the establishment of data transfer networks were all exceptional and premature in the way in which they developed. It was the banking industry, prior to other sectors that stimulated the demand for certain technologies, which was somewhat idiosyncratic when compared to other countries.
N84|Entrepreneurship Perceptions in Romania: Where Do We Stand?|In Romania, like in other ex-communist countries, entrepreneurial culture is still recovering from more than 50 years of communism. Romanian academic research in the field is still at its beginnings, with more primary research needed. In this article we aim to offer an analysis of perceptions of entrepreneurship of potential entrepreneurs, based on the interpretation of the results of a primary research regarding entrepreneurship developed in April 2012. The results of the survey show that Romanian potential entrepreneurs are mostly motivated to open a business by the financial security, profit, independence and financial prosperity. On the overall, Romanians manifest an internal locus of control, considering that motivation is the second important condition for success in a business. Also, they manifest trust in business, management and entrepreneurial education and a positive perception of their own entrepreneurship potential, a cultural and social background that is positive for entrepreneurship development; despite this, additional institutional and financial support is still needed, according to the perceptions of the respondents.
N84|La pequeña y mediana empresa en la edad de oro de la economía española: estado de la cuestión|The article is about the evolution of small and medium-sized firms in the period of the so called “desarrollismo” (1959-1975). We analyze the growth of these firms comparing the process to that of big Spanish firms in the same period. The data has been obtained from the information existent at the Instituto Nacional de Estadística about all the industrial sectors. One of the most interesting conclusions is related to the data from the INE about small and medium-sized firms, as it does not seem to agree with classical economic theory that considers big firms to be more efficient. The data sheds light on this matter very clearly. However, there still remain many aspects which are difficult to quantify, such as the impact of different industrial policies, the effects of tariffs and the quantification of the effects of regulations throughout all this period.

Este trabajo examina tal relación a través del análisis de la inversión directa estadounidense en España desde sus inicios con el siglo xx hasta 1975. Los resultados obtenidos enfatizan el protagonismo creciente de los socios locales en la entrada y evolución de las multinacionales estadounidenses; muestran cómo la constitución de sociedades conjuntas temporales fue un modo de entrada cada vez más recurrente; señalan un grado creciente de implicación en el mercado español por parte de las foráneas; matizan el efecto del nacionalismo económico sobre las empresas extranjeras; y, por último, sugieren la existencia de un marco proclive a la colaboración entre las matrices americanas y las filiales españolas que se fue formando en el transcurso del siglo xx .

N84|Responses to a crisis: FASA-Renault in Spain during the 1970s|This paper analyses the trajectory of the Spanish automobile firm FASA-Renault during the 1970s. This period comprises the early years of the crisis experienced by the Spanish economy and industry between 1974 and 1985. At the external level, the Spanish economy was affected by two oil shocks. At an internal level, the automobile industry was affected by a decree passed by the government: the so-called Ford decree of 1972, which allowed the establishment of the American company in Spain and had serious consequences for SEAT, the main Spanish producer. The production of SEAT suffered a one third reduction between 1972 and 1980 and, in addition, the financial situation of the firm was unsustainable. Conversely, during this stage FASARenault became the main Spanish production (its outpout was multiplied by 3,5 during the 1970s) and sales leader in Spain (its sales as percentage of total Spanish market sales increased from 23 to 36%). The main aim of this paper is to analyse the trajectory of success of FASA-Renault in Spain durig the 1970s.
N84|The origins of Made in Spain fashion. The competitive advantage of the textile, apparel and footwear districts since the Golden Age|This paper explores the sources of competitive advantage of the Spanish export industrial districts that specialised in textile, apparel and footwear products. It shows that most of the nowadays outstanding Spanish firms in fashion-related international markets emerged from 1980s districts. Using a new database, the paper concludes that by then there were as many neo-Marshallian exporting districts dominated by small firms as hub-firm districts coordinated by medium-large companies. This probably allowed the latter to combine the advantages derived from Marshallian external economies (i.e. non-codified knowledge, subsidiary industries and specialized labour force) with those connected to leading firms organizational capabilities.
N84|Italian Firms in History: Size, Technology and Entrepreneurship|The economic performance of a country depends, among other things, on the strategies and structures of its firms. In the framework that is designed by institutions and policies and determined by technology and macroeconomic cycles, entrepreneurs decide how to allocate available resources in order to face off competitors and to hook up with demand cycles. This paper looks at the evolution of the Italian economy across the last 150 years from a business history perspective. Analyzing Italian firms over the long-term cycles of the global economy and with respect to the different paradigms of the three industrial revolutions, we identify some structural features that explain successes and failures of the Italian economy. In doing this we explicitly connect the micro level of the business enterprise to the macro one of the national business system and explain the comparatively good performance of the Italian economy from the end of the 19th century to the 1970s. Over the last three decades this performance has turned negative, highlighting the role played by the small average size of firms and the failure of institutions to provide incentives for growth.

Finally the paper focuses on few cases of ""new protagonists"", mid-size family companies who undertook a true multinational strategy only in the most recent decades and today represent the core of the Italian ""fourth capitalism""."

N84|French mega-suppliers’ trajectories during the modular era: some evidences on Faurecia, Valeo and Plastic Omnium|The purpose of this paper is to present factual elements concerning the rise (decline) of French mega-suppliers. The study will focus on France’s three main mega-suppliers, all actors that have had a stake in carmakers’ modularisation strategies: Faurecia, Plastic Omnium and Valeo. Section 1 returns to the late 1980s and shows that the emergence of today’s mega-suppliers is rooted in this era and was piloted by French carmakers. Section 2 positions French mega-suppliers in a global hierarchy and distinguishes between two varieties: suppliers of simple parts; and module suppliers, with the latter constituting the focus for the rest of this text. Section 3 shows how module suppliers’ rise is rooted in their aggressive mergers and acquisitions (M&A) strategies. It also demonstrates differences between suppliers in terms of the two leading acquisition strategies that were observed. Section 4 explains why these companies’ profitability continues to disappoint, developing the idea that modular strategies imply a big rise in fixed costs, something that suppliers cannot knock onto sales prices. Finally, section 5 returns to companies’ internationalisation strategies and offers a typology for the different entities that mega-suppliers consolidate
N84|In quest of the stages of renewal of French entrepreneurship in the years 1950s-2000s (In French)|Having already fixed the arguments about French entrepreneurship in a previous on a long term scope, we focus our paper on the French syndrome about low entrepreneurship throughout the challenges of the rebuilding of economic power and growth after WWII within the framework of planification, at times when the very substance of economic elites was at stake among the business associations, the regional communities of business and the state economic apparel. The 1960s-1970s seemed to foster a balance between from a “from the top approach” and a “from the basis” renewal of entrepreneurship, thanks to new layers of entrepreneurial bourgeoisies, either family business or transfers from the state system – France being supposed to become the “South Korea of Europe”. But the crisis of the 1970s-1990s shook this regarnished confidence: doubtful elites reconsidered the “French model” along issues of differenciation and competitiveness, within the mindsets of “eurosclerosis” and a specific type of “declinism”. We’ll thus ponder the evolution of entrepreneurial reactivity throughout the dismantle of traditional family business and industries and the upsurge of new productive models; and once more tackle the argument about the role of the state in fuelling entrepreneurship and about the ever-dreamed rebirth of “productive districts” and creative communities of entrepreneurship.
N84|A Crisis that Never Came. The Decline of the European Antarctic Whaling Industry in the 1950s and -60s|The paper analyses the decline and final close down of the European Antarctic whaling industry in the 1950s and -60s. This industry had been led by British and Norwegian companies, which were now challenged by Japan and Soviet Union that completely took over Antarctic whaling for the next decades. The decline most severely affected Norway where the whaling industry was relatively more important than in any other country. The decline was also disproportionally felt in Norway because the country provided crew and equipment to many foreign whaling companies. The paper will therefore have a special focus on the Norwegian industry and how the challenges were faced there. The analysis reveals that the decline did not develop into a crisis for the companies involved or in the wider economy. One main explanation was that business cycles in shipping and in the general economy were very favourable during the years when the whaling industry was wound up.
N84|Governance in Spanish Savings Banks. A Historical Perspective|During the previous three decades, mutual financial firms have been experiencing a process of demutualization, and some of the non-for-profit banks have become publicly listed companies. Hence, the persistence of the Spanish Savings Banks constitutes an interesting case study. In line with recent literature, this paper attempts to reach a better understanding of the factors that have contributed to the persistence of these entities in the long run and to the maintenance of a very specific model of corporate governance. Regulatory influences, politics and political institutions have proved to be key elements of a model which has proved capable of delivering successful outcomes in increasingly competitive conditions. Nonetheless, the financial crisis would seem to have exacerbated the stresses and strains within this model and, in combination with the pressure of increasingly globalized markets, the Spanish Savings Banks find themselves in a new scenario.
N84|From national monopoly to multinational corporation: How regulation shaped the road towards telecommunications internationalisation| One of the consequences of major regulatory reform of the telecommunications sector from the end of the 1970s -- particularly, privatisation, liberalisation and deregulation -- was the establishment of a new business environment which permitted former national telecommunications monopolies to expand abroad. From the 1990s, a number of these firms, particularly those based in Europe, joined the rankings of the world's leading multinational corporations. Their internationalisation was uneven, however: while some firms internationalised strongly, others ventured abroad much slower. This article explores how the regulatory framework within which telecommunications incumbents evolved over the long-term shaped their subsequent, uneven, paths to internationalisation. Two case studies representing ‘maximum variation’ are selected: Telefónica, whose early and unrelenting expansion transformed it into one of the world's most international of multinational corporations, and BT, whose overseas ventures failed and, with eroding domestic market share, forced the firm to partially retreat, becoming the least international of the large European incumbents. Long-term ownership, access to capital, management style and exposure to liberalisation strongly influenced firms' approaches to internationalisation.
N84|De sale à durable ? Le tannage du XIXe au XXIe siècle<BR>[From dirty to sustanaible ? Tanning industry nineteenth to twenty-first century]|The tanning industry is presented today, by its own enterprises but also in the media, as a champion of sustainable development through the come back of the vegetable method, abandoned since the early twentieth century. The argument is problematic in relation to the concept of sustainable development itself, but also with regard to the history of this industry which is in contrary among the most polluting. The abandonment of vegetable tannage at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries must be understood by situating this technological development in its economic and social framework. Adherence to sustainable development seems well, therefore, like a recent development to meet the challenges of the sector.
N84|Les industries animales dans l'ouest de la France : les territoires industrielles de Chateau-Renault et Surgères<BR>[Animal industries in western France : the industrials territories of Chateau-Renault and Surgères]|The author of this paper intends to compare two industrial territories from western France: Chateau-Renault and Surgères. Chateau-Renault is a tanning center, and the city of Surgères houses a vast dairy. The industries of both areas deal with products of animal origins deriving from agriculture. They could be named “animal industries”. Besides, both areas are located in the west of France, where industrialization lagged behind the rest of the country. The author will study the mechanism at work behind the development of those industries in a region with very little industry overall. The relationship between local resources, notably agriculture, and the development of a specific form of industrialization are central to the emergence of those animal industries.

Origini e sviluppo dei consorzi di cooperative sociali|Il saggio si propone di studiare la struttura organizzativa, cio� l�integrazione tra imprese sviluppata dalla cooperazione sociale in Italia nel corso dei suoi trent�anni di storia. Accanto a una rappresentanza politico-sindacale il movimento della cooperazione sociale ha sentito il bisogno di integrarsi in un sistema consortile organizzato su pi� livelli. Per espletare al meglio i propri compiti, infatti, le cooperative sociali si avvalgono del Consorzio, un soggetto imprenditoriale che quasi mai opera nella parte finale della filiera, raramente si colloca sul mercato dei servizi finiti, preferisce stare nel mezzo: per produrre servizi alle imprese. L�articolo evidenzia infine l�evoluzione del ruolo del sistema consortile: da un compito di tipo promozionale e politico-sindacale si � passati ad uno pi� mirato. Il consorzio tende a svolgere un numero minore di funzioni, e sempre pi� specifiche, soprattutto per rafforzare il profilo imprenditoriale delle cooperative sociali e della rete nel suo complesso.
N84|Towards the alternative measurement: Discovering the relationships between technology adoption and quality of life in Indonesia|The vast majority of the studies investigating telecommunication development (diffusion of mobile phone, Internet, the broadband, etc.) that have been carried out in the literatures aim at assessing the impact on economic indicators, mainly the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), whereas little attention has actually been paid to investigate the other measurement which reflects a more direct linkage to the individual welfare, for instance the quality of life (QOL) indicators. Following the current counterargument for using the GDP as the goal of economic development, this paper investigates a survey data in Indonesia, observing the relationships between the experience to technology (the length of mobile phone ownership) and technology adoption (internet access) in affecting quality of life (QOL) at individual level. The QOL index is proxied by two indicators which are equally weighted; the objective measurement represented by income level and subjective perceived QOL following the study by Costanza et al., (2007). To operationalize these aims, the model is investigated in two sequential ways; first by determining binomial probit on the Internet access demand equation and then putting the predicted probability of the first equation into second equation of the ordered probit model. The model is further analyzed through the return to education-type equation (Card, 2001) to see the impact of experience to technology and internet access on the QOL index. The results indicate that whereas the access to the Internet is not statistically significant affecting QOL, experience to technology plays an important role. Additionally, the experience of technology (measured at its mean value of 3.5 years) affects the likelihood to have a lower QOL index around 49% and to achieve a higher QOL index in Indonesia around 12%. A year additional of ownership reduces the likelihood on a lower QOL by 3.6% and increases the likelihood to obtain a higher QOL by 2%.

It investigates the reasons of the economic retardation of this central region in contrast with the periphery of the country. It also presents the unknown attempts of the local business class to exploit large industrial conglomerates. The evidence shows that the region did not lack of entrepreneurial spirit. Actually, in spite the adverse agricultural conditions, the Government protection, the little modernisation of its capital market and its large risk aversion, Valladolid became the main industrial district of the region thanks to its specialization in food production and metallurgy
N84|Aproximación a la historia de la industria de equipos y componentes de automoción en España|The automotive components industry —nowadays the third Spanish industrial sector— arose in Spain at the beginning of the 20th Century. Its development was slow, as was the development of the local automobile industry, but before 1936 it had achieved a significant size and was in process of growth and modernization. The Spanish Civil War and the industrial policy of the forties slowed down this process, but in the fifties the industry grew quickly while the automobile industry took off. The rapid growth of the supplier industry between 1950 and 1970 took place in a protectionist framework, which limited its modernization and caused shortage of components. But after the liberalization of the seventies, it succeeded in modernizing and internationalizing, although this was to a great extent attributable to the multinational companies established in Spain.

FASA owned the licence to manufacture the Renault 4CV in Spain, and between 1953 and 1958 produced 26,298 units, which represented 29% of the total Spanish output. The period was marked by disagreements both between the Spanish partners and between the Spanish partners and Renault, the technology supplier, and by the need to satisfy the requirements of domestic production. Drawing on unpublished primary sources of information (the Minutes of the Board of Directors and the Shareholders’ Meetings) the article analyses the development of FASA during its early years. The article explores the hypothesis that the developer of FASA decided to locate the factory in Valladolid for personal reasons. Moreover, it shows that the fact that the Spanish market was closed was the main factor in obliging Renault to grant the manufacturing licences. KEY Classification-JEL: L62, N64, N84, O14
N84|How do Electoral Systems Affect Fiscal Policy? Evidence from State and Local Governments, 1890 to 2005|Using a new data set on Swiss state and local governments from 1890 to today, we analyze how the adoption of proportional representation affects fiscal policy. We show that proportional systems shift spending toward broad goods (e.g. education and welfare benefits) but decrease spending on targetable goods (e.g. roads and agricultural subsidies). Our evidence does not suggest that proportional representation increases the overall size of government. We provide new evidence on the mechanism behind these estimates. We show that proportional elections lead to better political representation of left-wing parties, which are associated with more spending. Furthermore, proportional elections lead to higher political fragmentation. However, since political fragmentation increases spending in a plurality system only, proportional elections reduce spending through its more moderate effects of fractionalized parliaments.
N84|Banking in Savoy and embeddedness within local business communities (1860- (In French)|The annexation of Savoy by France fuels the issue of the fate of Banque de Savoie, because Banque de France was reluctant to share its monopoly as bank of issue, which explains the absorption of its rival in 1865. A second issue was the creation of local banking tools, embedded in regional business communities, as leverage to industrial clusters at the heart of the alpine productive system. Two big family banks and four mutual institutions reflected this Savoyard will to resist the grip of banks from Paris, Lyon, and Geneva. A third issue became the “type” of business model of Savoy banks, between a classical discount model, a type of enterprise banking committed to industrial finance in favour of customer companies, and, last, “regional banking”, quite mixed banking. Each period of the Savoy economic growth privileged this variety of models, before a convergence towards a more balance model of commercial banking took shape after WWII.

The entrepreneur him/herself has a great influence on the characteristics of cooperation as well, besides these processes pushing them to the direction of cooperation, whose intention to get involved depends on his/her skills, abilities, but such characteristics of the company like scale, fields of activities affect it too. Economic, social and cultural circumstances are of major importance too, among which the above mentioned factors pursues their effects. Cooperation among companies can happen on any fields of the firms’ activities, for example research and development, marketing, purchase, or trading. This present paper intends to introduce the reader to the characteristics of supplier-purchaser relationships of small- and medium sized enterprises, based on an empirical research’s experiences. According to our opinion, we can draw conclusions on the intention to cooperate concerning the nature of the buyer-supplier relationships of companies, so a wide range of information can be concluded on small- and medium sized enterprises’ partnerships.

Breda per Costruzioni Meccaniche, durante la prima metà del Novecento. La ricerca si focalizza sulla forza lavoro considerata più stabile dell’impresa, cioè quella composta dagli operai che hanno mantenuto, in modo continuativo, la loro occupazione in fabbrica per più di dieci anni. L’obiettivo finale è duplice. Da un lato si vogliono individuare le motivazioni che hanno, di volta in volta, portato la Società a consolidare al proprio interno una parte della propria manodopera. Dall’altro l’idea è quella di cogliere le ragioni che hanno spinto i lavoratori a far perdurare nel corso del tempo la relazione industriale attivata al momento dell’assunzione con l’azienda. I dati necessari a raggiungere gli scopi dell’indagine sono stati desunti dalle informazioni contenute nei Registri del Personale della Sezione II, redatti direttamente dall’impresa a partire dal 1894 fino ad arrivare al 1951. Le registrazioni effettivamente interessanti hanno riguardato in totale 553 casi. Per ognuno di questi è stato ricostruito il profilo storico, sottolineando in particolare gli aspetti inerenti il percorso di evoluzione professionale avvenuto in ciascun rapporto di lavoro. Da questo esame particolareggiato sono, poi, state tratte le considerazioni di insieme sulle peculiarità dell’intera classe di operai afferente a questo gruppo e, in ultima analisi, si è giunti a dare risposta alle problematiche avanzate dallo studio. Pertanto, nella parte iniziale il saggio si prefigge di fornire una breve introduzione di carattere generale sulla tematica da esaminare. Nel secondo paragrafo, invece, viene presentata una valutazione globale dei rapporti di lavoro complessivamente instaurati alla Sezione Ferroviaria tra il 1894 e il 1951. Infine, nel paragrafo che precede le conclusioni, l’attenzione viene completamente dedicata alla questione delle lunghe permanenze in fabbrica e alle sue determinanti.
N84|Virgin Finance: Sir Richard Brandson’s pursuit of a significant presence in retail financial services|This teaching case study tells of the foundation and growth of the Virgin Group over the forty years to 2010. The creation of over 300 business interests in parts as far afield as the UK, South Africa, Australia and the USA resulted from a unique management style. Branson and the Virgin brand often associate with music (such as records and music stores) and travel (airlines, trains and booked holidays) but between August 2007 and February 2008 they were involved in a failed takeover of Northern Rock, a collapsed British bank. However, as this case study details, the Northern Rock affair was one of a long series of steps dating to the 1980s through which Branson and Virgin have been developing capabilities to enter the British retail banking sector.
N84|L’artisan entre histoire et theorie economique (Craftsman between history and economic theory)|L’artisan est né en France (juridiquement) pendant la crise de 1929. L’objectif principal de ce texte est de faire le point sur l’histoire de l’artisanat depuis le moyen âge à nos jours. L’artisan pouvait ainsi être un serf au moyen âge, et est un entrepreneur aux 20-21ème siècles. D’où le second but de notre texte : montrer que l’artisan est aujourd’hui un entrepreneur selon la théorie économique de l’entrepreneur en se basant sur trois critères : incertitude et risque, détecter les opportunités d’investissement et innovation. The craftsman is born in France (according to the law) during the 1929 economic crisis. The main purpose of this text is to review the history of the craft sector from the middle age to the 21th century. The craftsman could be a serfdom during the middle age period, and he is an entrepreneur today. So, the second purpose of this text is to show that the craftsman is today an entrepreneur according three criteria of the economic theory of entrepreneurship: uncertainty and risk, process of discovery of opportunities of investment and innovation.
N84|On the ICT Economy in the European Countries: Investigating the Contribution of the ICT Sectors Using the Input-Output Model|Investigating the Contribution of the ICT Sectors Using the Input-Output Model Previous studies have been devoted to investigating the future of economic growth and examining the importance of technology and the ICT sectors in accelerating the growth of the economy. These studies are from a macro perspective that emphasizes the role of infrastructure investment, as well as from the firm level analysis, which is mainly related to cost efficiency. In addition, recent studies of the European countries indicate that the region is now facing a weakening effect regarding the contribution of the knowledge economy, which slows economic growth. This study aims at investigating the contribution of the ICT sectors in driving economic performance in the European economies with a sectoral approach using the Input-Output (IO) methodology. The method measures the contribution of ICT sectors based on the OECD's definition (2009) and decomposing it into several variables. In addition, the study focuses on investigating one decomposition factor related to technological change effects. The results indicate that the growth of ICT sectors' output declined considerably during 2000-2005 compared to 1995-2000. The decomposition analysis found that the ICT sectors have lost the advantage of export and technological change effects. It has also been ascertained that the smaller impact of technological change effects is due to the lack of connection between the ICT sectors and other sectors on the production side. At country level, this analysis consistently explains this phenomenon, especially in Germany and Spain but fails to detect it in France, where the technological change effect remains stable given the lack of connection between ICT sectors and the rest of the economy.
N84|Un Zaibatsu fuera de lugar: los orígenes del Grupo Fierro (1870?1939)|This work is focused on the origins and starting of Fierro’s Group. Ildefonso Fierro (1882?1961) was one of the most prominent businessmen of Franco’s Regime. Fierro’s case study presents two features that distinguish it from other Spanish family firms born in the first half of the twentieth century: its high degree of diversification and its peculiar financial history. Prior to the commencement of the Franco dictatorship, Fierro has managed to form a diversified family business and has bought a bank to finance his industrial activity. This article analyzes how he achieved it and compares its path with that of the Japanese Zaibatsu (paper text in Spanish)
N84|La formación de un distrito industrial metalúrgico en Valladolid (c. 1842-c. 1953)|This work proposes a long term outlook in order to investigate the reasons explaining the development and importance of the metal-mechanic sector in Valladolid during the second half of the 20th century. We find that the political decisions after the Spanish Civil War of 1936 are determinant in explaining the change of size of this industrial district, but also that Valladolid knew how to take advantage of its privileged geographic situation, its means of transport -Canal and Railway-, and the introduction of electric power at the beginning of the century, to free itself from an excessive dependence on the agricultural sector for its development. Not only the political advantages coming out of the war, but also the tradition developed since 1842, explain the introduction of large companies in the next decades.

Just a few manufacturing or food Spanish companies had a similar presence in the European market. This paper wants to looks into the reasons of a short and successfully history. I try to proof that that was the consequence of its managerial and productive virtues and, most of all, its collaboration policy with other Spanish firms which belonged to the same sector. Nevertheless, Campofrío failed in its conquest of Latin America market. Its study could offer a less epic perspective of Spanish companies’ extension in this Continent during the last decades of the 20th century as well as give news references on their growth in West European countries.

N84|Between Agnelli and Mussolini: Ford's Unsuccessful Attempt to Penetrate the Italian Automobile Market in the Interwar Period|This article discusses one chapter of the interwar history of the Ford Motor Company in Europe rather neglected by historiography, namely its unsuccessful attempt to erect a solid base of operations in Italy. After WW1 the breaking into the Italian automobile market had been part of the Ford Motor Company’s strategy of internationalization. It seemed to go well beyond the exploitation of an additional European market: possibly, its most interesting and promising aspect was the utilization of an Italian branch as a bridgehead into the Balkans, the East Mediterranean region, the Middle East and North-East Africa. At the beginning this strategy turned out successful. But when, in the late 1920s, the American Company tried to improve its position in the country – either through the establishment of an assembly plant or a joint venture with an Italian firm – it turned out impossible. Conventional wisdom about such a failure has underlined the persevering hostility of Fiat, already the main Italian car producer, backed by Mussolini’s nationalistic economic policy. This was certainly the main cause. Yet, also on the Ford side some wavering and hesitation occurred. Therefore a few chances were missed: the most glamorous being an agreement, insofar totally neglected by historiography, with Fiat itself.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>
N84|Italian Entrepreneurship: Conjectures and Evidence from a Historical Perspective|This paper is the first product of an ongoing research on the determinants and the role of entrepreneurship in Italian economic development. Its primary aim is the creation of a data-set of Italian entrepreneurs for the period encompassed between the Unification of the Kingdom (1861) and the end of the XXth century. The main source of the research is a collection of 390 entrepreneurial biographies, prepared for an ongoing Dictionary of Italian Entrepreneurs. The first part of the paper presents a descriptive analysis of the main peculiarities of the country’s entrepreneurship on the basis of a few standard variables traditionally used in economic analysis. The second one refines the descriptive approach through a methodology – Multiple Correspondence Analysis and Cluster Analysis – usual by now in standard statistics, yet not very familiar to scholars in economic and/or business history. This has allowed us to single out a few entrepreneurial typologies of the history of Italian capitalism which partly confirm the “traditional” features already emphasized by historiography; such as the prominence of northern entrepreneurs, the strong relations both with own and partner’s families, the almost total absence of female entrepreneurs and an essentially middle-class rooted entrepreneurship. However a few novel interesting aspects emerge, the most surprising being the good level of formal education of the sample: a neat majority (60%) has a medium/high degree and almost one third an university degree.
N84|Reti migratorie e investimenti diretti esteri italiani: una prospettiva cliometrica|Un recente filone della letteratura economica sottolinea il ruolo delle reti migratorie nel consentire il superamento delle barriere informali che ostacolano lo sviluppo del commercio e degli investimenti internazionali. Questo saggio presenta un modello econometrico (OLS-IV) che considera l'impatto dell'emigrazione italiana all'estero e dell'immigrazione straniera in Italia sulla capacità del paese di generare e attrarre investimenti internazionali. Il principale risultato è che solo gli emigrati si dimostrano una determinante significativa degli investimenti diretti esteri italiani, sia in entrata che in uscita, mentre gli immigrati non sono una variabile significativa. Il saggio presenta poi una interpretazione dei risultati del test econometrico basata sulla ricostruzione di un profilo storico dell'emigrazione italiana all'estero e dell'immigrazione straniera in Italia e su alcune esemplari storie imprenditoriali.
N84|Institutional Clash and Financial Fragility. An Evolutionary Model of Banking Crises|There are mainly two types of theories explaining banking crisis, emanating from the monetarist school respectively institutional economics. Using an allegory, monetarists are discussing how much water in terms of liquidity that is needed to stop a fire escalating into a disaster, while institutionalists are occupied with the causes of the fire. Our study rejects the explanatory value of the monetarist view, but also criticizes the Kindleberger-Minsky model for not taking the legalisation and the sanctions in the hands of the authorities into account. We consider the institutional factor as a decisive part in the understanding of systemic risk and the process towards increasing debt in non-financial sectors and introduce the concept institutional clash. Not every recession has caused a banking crisis. But all banking crises have been preceded by an institutional clash. Consequently, an institutional clash is a prerequisite but not sufficient to cause a banking crisis: there must be a recession for a crisis to emerge. We also launch a stage-model for the evolution of banking crises. The stages in that model highlight decisive factors before, under and after a crisis. Our model has the capability to explain the occurrence of crises in a re-regulated economy. However, we only give few examples from Nordic banking crises how our model could be applied. Thus, the article is explorative. It is natural to make further empirical observation in order get a solid theory of driving forces behind banking crisis. The next step would be to empirically integrate all the Nordic banking crises between 1850 and 2000 in our analysis.
N84|The diversity of organisational forms in banking: France, Italy and Spain 1900-2000|This paper examines, from a historical perspective, the gradual entrance into the market of mutual and not for profit banks (specifically cooperative banks and savings banks), their continually increasing competitiveness with traded banks in France, Italy and Spain. In all three countries, these institutions played an important role in the retail banking sector. Special attention will be devoted to analysing the different models of adjustment adopted by the banking systems in the south of Europe in the wake of the deregulating process undertaken in the last quarter of the twentieth century. In summary, then, this paper is an attempt to identify the historical factors responsible for the persistence, or disappearance, of certain idiosyncratic aspects of the banking system in each country, together with the various adjustments produced in each case.
N84|Interpreting the Early Stages of the Self-service Revolution in Europe: the Modernization of Food Retailing in Spain, 1947-1972|This article explores the Americanisation of food retailing in Spain while making a running comparison with developments in Britain and more especially, within the development of self-service techniques. This international comparison helps to ascertain the evolution and modernisation of food retailing in two distinct competitive environments. The aim of this study is to understand how Americanisation and retail innovation take place in a late-comer like Spain in the early stages of the self-service revolution. The comparison between Spain and the UK facilitates how different starting points favoured differentiated entrepreneurial options which, finally led to similar positions or modes of development. The Americanization of Spanish retailing is assessed against the backdrop of developments elsewhere in Europe. New archival evidence allows us to highlight specific aspects of the path to the Spanish modernization of food distribution. In addition to American aid, there were other elements that were crucial to the modernization process, chief among these being the contacts between Spanish and European businessmen and the influence of voluntary chains of cooperation.
N84|Comparative performance of UK mutual building societies and stock retail banks: further evidence: a comment|Shiwakoti et al. (2008) concluded that four of the largest UK mutual societies which converted to listed bank status in 1997 outperformed, on a variety of measures, those societies which did not convert in the four-year periods both before and after conversion. All four converting societies have since been subject to ownership change, suggesting that this out-performance failed to persist, or was perhaps illusory. We do not criticise the results obtained by the authors, but suggest that they leave unanswered important questions, such as how to measure ‘superior’ performance and the appropriate time frame over which to evaluate this.
N84|Building Bankomat: The development of on-line, real-time systems in British and Swedish savings banks, c.1965-1985|The massification of retail finance in the 1980s relied on the successful deployment of automated teller machines (ATM) and on-line real-time (OLRT) computing during the 1960s and 1970s. We document how the deployment of ATM networks interweaved with the adoption of OLRT computing in Sweden and the UK (alongside a running comparison of similar developments in the USA). Low transaction volume and small retail bank networks facilitated the early adoption of OLRT by savings banks in America. Although they started their computerisation rather ‘late’, British savings banks benefited from adopting ‘tried and tested’ technology while overtaking clearing banks. Meanwhile, Swedish savings banks spearheaded technological change in Europe. In documenting cases of organizational change in Sweden and the UK, we depart from predominant view that considers the development of OLRT in a single move. We put forward the idea that there are specific conditions inside banking organisations that require considering on-line (OL) and on-line real-time (OLRT) as two distinct stage of development in adoption of computer technology. As a result, we show how in the process of diffusion of OLRT computing enabled the transformation of cash dispensers into ATM at the same time that European financial intermediaries were active in shaping technological change.
N84|Managing technological change by committee: Adoption of computers in Spanish and British savings banks (circa 1960-1988)|This article explores how savings banks managed the process of computerization through ad hoc management committees articulated under the aegis of national associations (with an emphasis on developments in Spain). The combination of cash payments (and low penetration of cheques) in the Spanish retail sector together with increasing administrative costs, acted as incentives for Spanish savings banks embracing applications of computer technology (and specifically data processing infrastructure) to articulate viable solutions for cost reductions, offer alternative payment systems to cash and facilitate greater diversification of their business portfolio within retail banking. A running comparison is made with similar developments in Britain. Computerization committees had little impact amongst the trustee savings banks. This responded to a combination of a poor corporate strategy and a number of external events (including regulatory constrains limiting their business portfolio as well as amalgamation into a single entity). By the mid-1970s it was evident that the trustee savings banks had lost a significant share of the total deposits in sterling made by UK residents. Meanwhile, collective investments in computer technology were instrumental for Spanish savings banks to successfully contest the domestic retail bank market.
N84|Intangible assets and competitiveness in Spain: an approach based on trademark registration data in Catalonia (1850-1946)|This paper studies the origins of trademark registration in Spain and offers, for the first time, data across sectors and regions with a long-term perspective. In apparent contradiction to the slow path of industrialization and the economic backwardness of Spain between 1850 and the 1940s, empirical evidence on trademark registration suggests that, in this field, Spanish policies and Spanish firms seemed to be well ahead of other countries. Spain was among the pioneering countries in the Western world in having a state legislation protecting brand registration since 1850. Also, some Spanish regions and industrialized sectors adopted similar strategies to those of its European counterparts in terms of using consistently branding and registered trademarks. Our evidence suggests that firms seem to have used brands and marks, first to fight against fraud and imitation and second to add intangible assets to its products in order to endow them with persistent identity trends regarding origins or quality of the product that were difficult to replicate, as often happened with patents. This created and accumulated, over that period of time, a marketing knowledge among consumers, which may have been useful to maintain the competitiveness of some industrial districts and regions.
N84|Sísifo en España: doscientos años de banca francesa (c.1800-c.2000)|With unpublished sources, this paper draws the evolution of French banking in Spain between 1800 and 2000 and shows how French banks operated in the country, seeking, once and again, to consolidate business positions in a more and more difficult market. As the oldest foreign bank presence in the country, French banks strongly dominated the Spanish market in the 19th century. The turn of the 20th century and the Spanish economic evolution meant a sort of hibernation for French banks. They only did with it in the middle of the fifties. The second half of the 20th means for French banking the search of a place in the difficult Spanish bank market. Following the legislation and economy evolution, French banks diversified their financial supply in the sixties, lent capitals in the seventies and the eighties, and tried to compete with Spanish commercial banks in the nineties. Its evolution, for almost one hundred and fifty years, allows us to analyze an episode of foreign direct investment (FDI), focused, in this occasion, in transnational banking. This paper tries to contribute in the debate about persistent and changing patterns of FDI in a host country in the long run.
N84|Las políticas redistributivas de la España no democrática: del objetivo industrializador al sostenimiento de los ingresos de los agricultores (1950-1975)|As suggested by the developmental pattern, policies to support farmers’ incomes developed in Spain from the 1960s onwards, when the country saw a process of rapid economic growth. Direct subsidies rapidly increased and price-support policies, similar to those applied for more advanced countries from 1950, expanded for many commodities. Budgetary restrictions were not an obstacle to the redistribution of resources to agriculture, because farm support in Spain was based essentially on market intervention and price support policies. In fact, only 10-20 per cent of today’s net transfers to agriculture in advanced countries come from subsidies and monetary transfers. From the 1960s, the intensity of support to Spanish farmers, as measured by the Nominal Protection Coefficient (NPC) and the Producer Support Estimate (PSE), was similar to that in the EEC. This result contradicts both Lindert’s assumption that agriculture gets more protection under democratic regimes and the olsonian view that large-scale intervention in agricultural markets results from the collective action of lobby groups.

N84|Turning Trade Marks into Brands: how Advertising Agencies Created Brands in the Global Market Place, 1900-1930|While historians and management students are familiar with the lore of how an internal memo at Procter & Gamble ‘invented’ brand management in 1931 (Fullerton, Low 1994; Dyer et al. 2004), little is known about how advertising agencies conceptualised and practiced branding during the early parts of the twentieth century. This paper presents evidence that by the 1920s advertising agencies drew on shared forms of implicit knowledge about consumer psychology which anticipated post-1950s debates about brand image, brand personality, brand identity, lifestyle brands and the global brand. I argue that large-scale, international advertising agencies discovered the symbolic and emotional capacities of brands in building consumer loyalty and in forming certain consumer identities much earlier than usually acknowledged. American and British agencies developed the field of tacit knowledge about the brand-consumer relationship as a source of competitive advantage in the competition for clients which increasingly sought consumers in overseas markets.
N84|Corporate Brand Building at Shell-Mex Ltd in the Interwar Period|This paper is an analysis of corporate brand building at Shell-Mex Ltd in the inter-war period in Britain. While there has been some historical analysis of product brand development in the UK, this has not been the case in corporate or institutional brand building which has remained neglected. This paper outlines this process at Shell-Mex, the distributive arm in Britain for the Shell Transport and Trading Company, part of the larger Royal Dutch Shell Group. The paper argues that Shell consistently and coherently built up its corporate brand in the inter-war period through a series of strategies which included publicity, sponsorship of record breaking flights, links with empire, use of prominent artists, documentaries, road guides and association with the British countryside. This development of its corporate brand had multiple benefits for the group, both internally within its organisation, and externally in relation to its product brands and overall competitiveness.
N84|The Rise Of Portuguese Multinational Enterprises (1980-2005)|This paper tries to make an assessment about the process of formation of Portuguese multinationals during the last quarter of century in the context of similar small emerging European economies. The main question to be addressed is how much Portuguese peculiarities shaped the transnationalization process of the Portuguese economy in a different way, when compared to other European economies of similar size, which have also undergone the modem economic growth process during the second half of the 20th century and the privatization process during the last quarter of century. The text focus on the consequences of two relevant facts for the Portuguese transnationalization process: the relative backwardness of Portugal, a latecomer to modem economic growth (a post WW II development, which only matured very recently along the terciarization process); the gradual evolution from import substitution policies (which protected firms from international competition and, eventually, made them less competitive abroad in the long run) to export-led growth. At the same time, the paper tries to identify the typical expansion strategies of active transnationalisation, while the main cases of Portuguese multinational firms will be reviewed and put in the context of the ranking of the World multinationals.
N84|Italian Diaspora and Foreign Direct Investment: A Cliometric Perspective|Recent economic literature highlights that migrant networks help to overcome the informal barriers that exist in the international markets and boost international investment. Empirical studies on different countries confirm this prediction. This paper estimates (OLS-IV) an econometric model to study the impact of both emigration and immigration on Italy’s bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI). The main result is that only the Italian diaspora has a significant positive effect on Italy’s both inward and outward FDI. A theoretical framework, a profile of the diaspora and of immigration in Italy and some exemplary entrepreneurial histories help to interpret the econometric evidence.
N84|Religion, longevity, and cooperation: The case of the craft guild|When the mortality rate is high, repeated interaction alone may not sustain cooperation, and religion may play an important role in shaping economic institutions. This insight explains why during the fourteenth century, when plagues decimated populations and the church promoted the doctrine of purgatory, guilds that bundled together religious and occupational activities dominated manufacturing and commerce. During the sixteenth century, the disease environment eased, and the Reformation dispelled the doctrine of purgatory, necessitating the development of new methods of organizing industry. The logic underlying this conclusion has implications for the study of institutions, economics, and religion throughout history and in the developing world today.
N84|Did Economics Cause World War II?|Historians have long recognized the role of economic resources and organization in determining the outcome of World War II: the Nazi economy lacked the economic resources and organization to oppose the combined might of the U.S., U.K., and U.S.S.R. A minority view is that the Germans were defeated not by economics, but by Hitler's many strategic and tactical mistakes, of which the most important was the invasion of the Soviet Union. Compared to this debate about the outcome of the war, there has been less attention to economics as the cause of World War II. This is a review article of a new economic history of the Nazi economy by Adam Tooze which cuts through the debate between economics and Hitler's mistakes as fundamental causes of the outcome. Instead, Tooze argues that the invasion of the Soviet Union was the inevitable result of Hitler's paranoia about the land-starved backwardness of German agriculture as contrasted with the raw material and land resources of America's continent and Britain's empire. The American frontier expansion that obliterated the native Indians provided Hitler with a explicit precedent, which he often cited, for pushing aside the native populations in the east to provide land for German Aryan farmers. Germany's agricultural weakness is summarized by its low land-labor ratio, but Poland and the Ukraine had even less land per person. Thus simply acquiring the land to the east could not solve Germany's problem of low agricultural productivity without removing the native farming populations. Far better than other histories of the Third Reich, Tooze reveals the shocking details of General Plan Ost, the uber-holocaust which would have removed, largely through murder, as many as 45 million people from eastern agricultural land. Tooze, like the Nazis before him, fails to emphasize that the solution to Germany's agricultural problem was not acquiring more land for the existing German farm population, but rather by raising the land-labor ratio by making the existing German land more efficient, mechanizing agriculture and encouraging rural-to-urban migration within Germany.
N84|Organisational change and the computerisation of British and Spanish savings banks, circa 1965-1985|In this article we explore organisational changes associated with the computarization of British savings banks while making a running comparison with developments in Spain. This international comparison addresses the evolution of the same organisational form in two distinct competitive environments in the late 20th century. Changes in regulation and technological developments (particularly applications of information technology) are said to be responsible for enhancing competitiveness of retail finance. Archival research on the evolution of savings banks helps to ascertain how, prior to competitive changes taking place, participants in bank markets had to develop capabilities to compete. Moreover, assess the response of collaborative agreements to opportunities opened by technological change (in particular resolve apparent scale disadvantages to contest bank markets). Of particular interest are choices made between applications of computer technology to redefine the relation between head office and retail branches as well as between staff at retail branches and customers.

To this end, different previously unused business sources are used, including professional reviews and journals, material which has been largely neglected. These sources shed light on the history food distribution in Spain. Special emphasis is placed upon the initial phase of the modern era of distribution and the role of some of the pioneers in the field. The revolution in retailing, which began in the 1970’s, is also placed under the spotlight, illuminating the structural changes that have lead to an intense process of concentration in the sector.

To exist in their territory, they communicate through diversified means throughout the 20th century. (Signs, advertising inserts, commercial documents...) This communication has its own themes thanks to which craftsmen try to improve the reputation of their business and stand out from the competition. They do therefore advertise.
N84|¿Misión imposible?: La expropiación de las empresas alemanas en España (1945-1975)|This article deals with a key issue in the economic development of the European periphery: the relationship between foreign investment and economic nationalism. The research focuses on the process of blockade, expropriation and reacquisition of German assets in Spain, which took place from 1945 to 1975. The process has been reconstructed by tracking its main characters: the German companies and their local partners, the Spanish groups interested in acquiring them, the Spanish and the German administrations, and the Allied Control Council. Our study reveals that, in the short run, the expropriation programme originated great business opportunities for the traditional partners of the German firms as well as for Spanish industrial banking. In the long run, however, due to private contracts between them and the German headquarters, the process allowed old owners to keep control of their assets and strengthen their position in the Spanish market.

N84|La primera crisis de SEAT: el veto a General Motors y la compra de AUTHI a British Leyland (1972-1976)|In 1972 SEAT was the first Spanish industrial firm and led the export of automobiles, thanks to a nationalist policy. However, the industrial policy of late Francoism experienced a dramatic change with the approval of Ford’s decrees. Such a change included the invitation to General Motors to rescue the Spanish subsidiary of British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC), AUTHI, in 1973. The purchase of its plant in Landaben by SEAT in 1975 has to be considered more the consequence of a pact preventing the entrance of General Motors than the outcome of direct pressure by government. The increase in the size of employment resulted to be a very risky decision for a company which was experiencing a significant push on labour costs since 1969 and a dangerous fall in demand since 1974. Moreover, the change of policy and the further removal of the veto on General Motors, would contribute to jeopardize the relationship with FIAT, ending the Honey moon experienced during the early seventies.

N84|Generational Effects on Adult Height in Contemporary Spain: Exploring Gender and Individual Heterogeneity|As adult height is a well-established retrospective measure of health and standard of living, it is important to understand the factors that determine it. Among them, the influence of socio-environmental factors has been subjected to empirical scrutiny. This paper explores the influence of generational (or environmental) effects and individual and gender-specific heterogeneity on adult height. Our data set is from contemporary Spain, a country governed by an authoritarian regime between 1939 and 1977. First, we use normal position and quantile regression analysis to identify the determinants of self-reported adult height and to measure the influence of individual heterogeneity. Second, we use a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition approach to explain the gender height gap and its distribution, so as to measure the influence on this gap of individual heterogeneity. Our findings suggest a significant increase in adult height in the generations that benefited from the countrys economic liberalization in the 1950s, and especially those brought up after the transition to democracy in the 1970s. In contrast, distributional effects on height suggest that only in recent generations has height increased more among the tallest. Although the mean gender height gap is 11 cm, generational effects and other controls such as individual capabilities explain on average roughly 5% of this difference, a figure that rises to 10% in the lowest 10% quantile.

We examine the minutes of the executive boards of two Basque firms, Altos Hornos de Bilbao and Vizcaya, to discuss the relevance of different factors on survival and failure of a number of explicit collusive agreements reached in the industry from 1886 to 1901. We find that collusion was more likely to break down in periods of falling demand, and that strong demand provides these agreements with stability. Additionally, we argue that the presence of centralized sales agencies, similar degrees of vertical integration among colluding firms, and tariff protection are factors that facilitate collusion.
N84|"Size, Structure, and Strategies: Insolvency and ""The Nature of the Firm"" in Italy, 1920S-1970S"|During the Twentieth century, Italian joint-stock companies remained relatively small and tended to die young. This fact constrained the development of the full potential of the Italian industry, as small-dimensioned companies struggled to implement the most efficient technologies and managerial techniques. This paper analyses this problem by looking at the functioning of insolvency procedures. Using quantitative and qualitative evidence, we show how various devices that progressively appeared on the scene failed in providing efficient solutions to re-start worthy companies. Insolvency procedures thus remained liquidation-prone, a factor that contributes to explain the peculiarity and the limits of Italian industrial capitalism.
N84|Le syst�me d�innovation de Benetton et ses limites|This paper focuses on the innovation system in the Benetton case: on the one hand, it puts in evidence the ability of the company in exploiting institutional conditions in order to develop a network organisation and a series of coordinated innovations; on the other hand, it investigates on the characteristics of the circulation of innovation among Benetton suppliers and distributors. The paper was presented at the conference Les syst�mes d�innovations: multiplicit� des �chelles, diversit� des espaces, Bordeaux, Maison de Sciences de l�Homme d�Aquitaine, November 16-17, 2006.
N84|Salarios y Programas de Bienestar Industrial en la empresa ferroviaria MZA (1915-1935)|We analyse in this paper the evolution of wages and salaries, in real and monetary terms, of permanent staff in the railway company MZA during the so-called “Railway Problem” period. Their understanding would not be complete without taking into account Industrial Social Welfare programmes, since these accounted for a high percentage of earnings. One of the main conclusions of this paper is that, during the period examined, the real income of railway employees improved and wage differentials between the various levels narrowed, although such levels continued to be very high.

N84|Empresas familiares y acuerdos cooperativos en el metal español: el caso de las industrias del alambre de hierro y acero (1880-1974)|Family ownership, reduced size of productive centers, and concentration are historical trends that characterize the development of the Spanish iron and steel wire firms in international comparison. Agreements at regional level between the most significant family firms of the sector allowed coordination, which proved to be useful to avoid absorptions and to keep family control in some of the most important firms during more than a century.

N84|Verkstadsindustri i globaliseringens tidevarv. En studie av SKF och Volvo 1970-2000|This working paper explores the impact of the globalization process 1970-2000 on two manufacturing industries in the Gothenburg area –SKF and Volvo. Three aspects of the process are highlighted: the development of new Information and Communication Technology (ICT), the increased mobility of capital, and the increased importance of knowledge in manufacturing industry. The history of the two companies is analyzed from the early 1970s to the turn of the century, using literature and interviews. Firstly, the paper explores the organizational development of the two companies. The study shows how SKF and Volvo during these years transformed from being organized as nationally oriented hierarchies to become nodes in global networks. Secondly, a number of specific themes are explored, such as ownership, branding, R&D, and outsourcing. The international ownership increased and the production is now coordinated on a global scale. The main conclusion of this working paper is that SKF and Volvo are representatives of an emerging informational economy. The flexibility generated by new ICT and more liquid financial markets has proven to promote economic growth, while at the same time generate social conflicts as the labour security decreases.
N84|Entrepreneurship and market order: Some historical evidence|Our objective here is to establish the proposition that creative entrepreneurship gives rise to a market order which is optimally adjusted to facilitate the introduction and the diffusion of innovations, particularly those that take the form of new markets, new organizational schemes, new management devices and new methods and means of doing business. To substantiate this claim we extract from the existing historical literature and employ the ideal type entrepreneurial method of the Greek diaspora network. The interpretation we offer is that this method showed a high degree of operational flexibility and institutional adaptability and that it is these two proper-ties that explain its marked tenacity over time. The key ingredient for its success is traced to the self-regulatory robustness of the network, which was secured by the commitment of its partners to a moral order based on the triptych of ‘trust, reliability and reciprocity’ as well as to their ac-ceptance in advance of the sanctions in case of transgressions. Moreover, the embeddedness of the branches of the network in the Greek communities abroad, called Paroikies, where the Greek Orthodox Church provided moral leadership and maintained the community ties, reinforced the adherence of network partners to the rules of ethical business conduct. But in our view the domi-nant force in the design of the core mechanism that made the Greek diaspora network such a suc-cess was entrepreneurship.
N84|Elda Pavan Cecchele e il mondo della moda: 1950-1970|This paper deals with the history of the Italian fashion. The figure of Elda Cecchele, a textile artisan (hand weaver) who worked in the second half of the last century with famous Italian fashion designers (Salvatore Ferragamo, Jole Veneziani, Roberta di Camerino, Franca Polacco) is analysed through her work and documents. Elda Cecchele's activity was creative and imaginative. She wove many different materials with incredible results. In addition she acted on behalf of Roberta di Camerino as an intermediary in creating a network of subcontractors working for the fashion firm exploiting the confidence and the reputation she had gained in the territory around her laboratory. In the sixties the Veneto countryside was still very poor and women were unemployed and obliged to emigrate so that her activity is remembered as a significant relief.
N84|Národní nebo individuální zájem: případ prvorepublikového Československa<BR>[National or individual interest: the case of the first- republic Czechoslovakia]|The key question of the presented thesis is what precisely economic nationalism means. The author uses the situation in Czechoslovakia between the two world wars as a background of her examination of both its dimensions, economic and nationalistic. She points out several problems arising from the use of the term. She also answers the question to what extent economic nationalism is economic and to what extent it is national. Following her empiric study of the effects of nationalism on economic relations, the author redefines the existing conception and suggests that emphasis be put on the terms economic emancipation and above all national economism. The latter expression describes non-standard economic relations - politically motivated creation of highly deformed market environments characterised by restricted entry opportunities, with the nationality of capital holders being the principal disqualifying condition.
N84|El ferrocarril como sector estratégico durante la Guerra Civil española: reorganización, explotación y consecuencias|El trabajo efectúa un análisis de la evolución del sector ferroviario durante la Guerra Civil española (1936-1939). Se trata de un tema que hasta el momento ha recibido una escasa atención y que consideramos puede ayudar a comprender el comportamiento de uno de los principales sectores económicos del país, así como su influencia en el devenir del conflicto. Para ello se estudia cómo se organizó tanto el sistema de transporte ferroviario en su conjunto como cada una de las compañías afectadas, atendiendo tanto a las decisiones políticas tomadas en cada uno de los bando como a las propias actuaciones llevadas a cabo por los gestores de estas empresas. A continuación se analiza como se desarrolló la explotación de esta actividad en unas condiciones tan sumamente difíciles y se finaliza efectuando una primera aproximación a la estimación de las pérdidas originadas directa o indirectamente por la guerra.

N84|Il trasporto pubblico locale: studio di una caso in una prospettiva storica|The present phase of liberalization of local public transport in European countries and in Italy marks the end of a cycle which began at the turn between XIX and XX centuries. After a summary of its developments in European countries and in the United States, we look carefully at its developments in Italy, where they have been overlapping for most time with the institution of Municipal firms. We rely heavily on a case study, on the ground that it could shed light on the rest of the sector. The paper concludes with some conclusions relevant for the present policy debate on local public transport in Italy.
N84|Hacia un cártel perfecto. Los acuerdos colusivos en el sector siderúrgico español (1871-1907)|The aim of this work is to analyse the process of cartelisation in the modern Spanish iron and steel industry from the first pricing agreements in 1871 to the creation of the Central Siderúrgica in 1907. Using documentation from archives of iron and steel companies, the article studies the internal operation of the cartels and the difficulties faced in detecting cheating and in avoiding competition from free riders. The work also aims to contribute to the debate on the responsibility of supply within the structure of the Spanish iron and steel market and its influence on the Spanish industrialization.
N84|Networks of People in Specialty Production: Family Firms in the Iron and Steel Wire Industries in Spain (1870-2000)|Capital intensive industries in specialized niches of production have constituted solid ground for family firms in Spain, as evidenced by the experience of the iron and steel wire industries between 1870 and 2000. The embeddedness of these firms in their local and regional environments have allowed the creation of networks that, together with favourable institutional conditions, significantly explain the dominance of family entrepreneurship in iron and steel wire manufacturing in Spain, until the end of the 20th century. Dominance of family firms at the regional level has not been an obstacle for innovation in wire manufacturing in Spain, which has taken place even when institutional conditions blocked innovation and traditional networking. Therefore, economic theories about the difficulties dynastic family firms may have to perform appropriately in science-based industries must be questioned.

A lo largo del trabajo se presenta la construcción gradual de sucesivas redes sociales formadas por contactos personales y profesionales y se muestra la emergencia en su seno de conflictos y tensiones entre los diferentes grupos.
N84|A short history of French spirit of enterprise (from 1780 till date) (In French)|Pessimistic views among French economist, political and scholar opinion givers have often prevailed about the assessment of French economic competitiveness ; that might be explained by negative surveys of the ability of economic elites to adapt themselves to the changes of the environment of competition and of the productive and technological systems. Breakdowns of enterprise spirit could thus explain that periods of sluggishness be imposed to French growth and, globally, that backwardness had been endured when factors of progress were at stake. Our text reconstitutes the overall issues and, then, proceeds, alongside chronological periods, to a large scrutinizing of the validity of these assertions, throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.
N84|The Impact of the Legal Milieu on the Private Enterprise in Czechoslovakia in the 1950s and the 1960s|This article deals with the repression against private enterprise in Czechoslovakia in the 1950s and 1960s. Czechoslovakia experienced the biggest changes in relation to the private enterprise out of all countries belonging to the Soviet block. During a few years after the incorporation to this block, the legal enterprising in Czechoslovakia had almost disappeared. Private enterprise was fi rstly restrained by prohibition, and consecutively by the laws that, in comparison to enterprise directed by the state, entailed a big handicap to private business. Later attempts to revive private enterprise were implemented with big diffi culties, owing to enduring opinions of the establishment of the Communist Party and the state. Its partial revitalisation had been thus implemented only underhandedly and under extremely restrained conditions.
N84|La gestión privada de los montes públicos en España. El caso del empresario Echevarrieta (1920-1933)|This article deals with a businessman who exploited the Spanish public forest land during the inter-war period. This study helps to fill a gap in the history of Spanish forestry, suffering from a general shortage of examples such as the one presented here. I will detail the various stages of his forestry endeavour, set against the background of his other businesses, and point to possible causes of his failure. In order to accomplish this, I will use a first-hand source, the Echevarrieta y Larrinaga collection in the Civil War Section of the Spanish National Historic Archive. Finally, I have come to the conclusion that the difficulties in the felling process itself, market complexity, transportation problems together with the lack of protection are the main factors that explain why private enterprise did not always fair well in the forestry business.
N84|Why did modern trade fairs appear?|According to our interpretation, modern trade fairs started in Europe during the First World War and in its immediate aftermath. With the closing of trade movements during the war, many cities had to resort to the old medieval tradition of providing especial permits to traders to guarantee them personal protection during their trade meetings. During the tough post war crisis many more cities –typically industrial districts- discovered in the creation of trade fairs a powerful competitive tool to attract market transactions. We compare these developments with the remote origins of fairs, as, in both cases, trade fair development is a reaction to the closing of free markets under the pressure of political violence.
N84|Strategie di speculazione, di sopravvivenza e frodi bancarie prima della grande crisi|"The paper analyses the causes of the wildcat banking in Italy after the First World War. The hypothesis is that financial instability in banking sector increased after the monetary deflation and the resumption of gold standard. Two levels of analysis are considered: a macroeconomic one and a microeconomic one. A faulty regulation and a sticky transmission of monetary policy retarded the effects of monetary deflation on the credit expansion because of the ineffectiveness of this policy in reversing expectations. Wildcat banking booming in more local banks with ""non profit"" organization in which corporate control schemes took responsability away from managers or majority shareholder groups. Also a new national regulation on the banking sector, enacted in 1926, was defective owing to many overlappings between the regulation agencies (Tresury and central bank). Both a loss of monetary policy credibility and an incomplete system of regulation clashed with the spur of looting. The case of the Marinelli's banking group is a typical example of overfinancing supported by a lot of politicians. In this turbid business of looting are included both profiteers and tentatives of acquisition in small and large banks trough a financial watering of social capital. The rise of such business depends on a loss of confidence in monetary policy, also after Pesaro's announcement."
N84|Causas, intereses y desarrollo histórico de la acción colectiva empresarial en el ámbito agrario: el caso del cooperativismo en el sector oleícola|The objective of this paper is explore the roots of the co-operative movement in the food oil sector from a historical perspective through a bibliographical review of the diverse studies carried out at the regional and provincial levels in Spain. It explores the causes of co-operatives’ creation and the profile of the farmers who benefited from the experience. It ascertains the level of business development in the organisational, human and technological spheres, analysing the conditioning factors limiting co-operative action to the stockpiling and production areas, with little penetration in cooperation at the second level of bottling and refining. An empirical study is made of evolution in one of the Spanish provinces where the incidence of this type of co-operative is significant.
N84|Alfred D. Chandlers Konzept der learning base und seine Anwendung auf den Unterhaltungselektronikhersteller Loewe|The aim pursued in this business history study is to assess whether LOEWE - an originally German-Jewish producer of consumer electronics - had the possibility as well as the capacity to build and preserve a learning base throughout the national-socialist period. Learning base is understood here in the sense expounded by the American business historian, Alfred D. Chandler, in his investigation of firms who boast long-term prosperity. After a discussion of this concept, it is applied to LOEWE for the period running from 1923 to 1945. The main thrust of this paper is a focus on the construction of the organisational substructure that supports the learning base in the 1920s. The erosion of the technical knowledge base is then monitored in the field of television research - a domain which will prove central for the firm in the future - as a consequence of the political persecution brought about by the Third Reich.
N84|Perspectiva histórica del cooperativismo de crédito agrícola en Canarias|Two savings banks are currently active in the Canary Isles: Caja Rural de Tenerife and Caja Rural de Canarias, and these are furthermore the only two loan co-operatives in the region. And as they are also virtually the only loan co-operatives that have been successful, to talk about the economic trajectory followed by the two rural savings banks is equivalent to dealing with the whole of co-operative agricultural credit in the Canary Isles. This is the objective of this paper; to analyse the savings banks’ evolution. In the first section we look at when and why the agrarian co-operative societies emerge in Europe and Spain, while in the second part we look at the Canary Isles case in particular. The third and fourth sections deal with evolution of leading economic aggregates, respectively up to 1987 and later years.
N84|Productividad, competencia e innovación en la banca privada española (1900–1914)|This study investigates the productivity differences and its sources across a set of banks during the last years of the liberal era of the Spanish banking system (1900-1914). These years were characterised by major qualitative and quantitative changes in the banking industry including a sharp increase in the size of the system, in the number of firms, and in its regional distribution. Employing DEA productivity analysis and the Malmquist index, we discover that these changes were accompanied by a generalised increase in the efficiency of least productive banks. Also, we observe that the crisis of some regional banking groups, like the Catalan, can be linked with its low productivity levels. In consequence, in the light of our productivity evidence, we conclude that the increase in competition was beneficial for the system because helped to the success of the most efficient banks.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

This article considers the history of the office at Leyden, where between 1865 and 1969 a whole lifecycle of a branch of De Nederlandsche Bank took place.
N84|Successes of trade reorientation and expansion in post-communist transition: an enterprise-level approach|"The article offers an approach to the westward reorientation of foreign trade by the post-communist economies of East-Central Europe at the micro--i.e. enterprise--level. Having presented the dynamics of reorientation and its theoretical/historical underpinnings, the writer then goes on to underline the surprisingly large number of microeconomic determinants behind the strong westbound export surge. The article starts with the most often cited factor, namely the distressed sale argument, and then shifts the focus to determinants that have received far less attention: an unusual extension of the ""distressed sale"" argument and another, more important one, namely the legacy of the oversized industrial sector and resultant availability of firms ready (or forced) to test their mettle on the world markets. The following section extends the list of determinants to foreign direct investment and the growing export activity of domestic de novo firms. The linkages between the determinants are also pointed out. The final section sums up the observations."

N84|Are Prices Higher For the Poor in New York City?|Despite earlier evidence to the contrary, recent inquiries appear to reach a consensus that the poor pay more for food. However, these studies utilize samples drawn on the basis of prior knowledge of unfair pricing strategies, proximity of volunteer surveyors, or other non-random methods. This paper revisits the issue of price discrimination by analyzing price data collected using a stratified, random sample design to answer the question of whether prices are higher in poor, urban neighborhoods. Contrary to the recent literature, I find that market prices in poor neighborhoods are not higher than those in more affluent areas.
N84|Perceptions of the Royal Mail Case in the Netherlands| The 1931 Royal Mail case, as a landmark event in the history of British accountancy, did not go unnoticed in the Netherlands. Awareness of the case is reflected by a fairly wide scattering of references in contemporary Dutch documentary sources, notably in the literature of the auditing profession. Because of this, the case provides a convenient opening for studying the comparative development of accounting and auditing in Britain and the Netherlands. This paper documents Dutch references to the Royal Mail case from the 1930s to the early 1950s and it presents an interpretation of the pattern and nature of these references. The materials brought together in this paper show that in interpreting the Royal Mail case, Dutch auditors paid more attention to general issues of auditor responsibility than to the issue of secret reserve accounting with which the case is traditionally associated. The case provided support for those who argued with Limperg that the Dutch profession was ahead of Britain in its views on auditor responsibility.
N84|External Trade in Italy, 1922-38 .Some Evidence from Trade Index Numbers|This paper presents new estimates of value and quantity indices for Italian exter-nal trade in goods from 1922 to 1938, Trade in goods is defined so as to exclude transit trade and reparations but to include trade with the Itahan colornes and possessions. The quantity is defined as the net weight of the goods transferred or their number, and the urnt value as the value per unit of quantity. The constructed price and quantlty indi-ces are fixed-weighted indices. What ISTAT tells us about the construction of their trade series is not much and is not by any means clear. Firstly, we are told that the available ISTAT series is a sample senes and, 'although it is claimed that the sample is very lar-ge, we are not told the categories that have been left out. Secondly, the old unlt value figures are chain indices applied to the Laspeyres formula, using the previous quantities as weights; a procedure that can considearably distort the price changes. Thirdly, quan-tity indices are indirectly obtained by dividing total current value indices by unit value indices, a procedure which is not particular1y recommended.
